"""
PreToolUse(Bash) hook: block a git commit whose message would make GitHub CLOSE
an issue the author is deliberately leaving open.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why a hook rather than a convention.

GitHub treats a closing keyword followed by an issue reference as an instruction
to close. It does not care that the surrounding sentence says the opposite, so a
line written specifically to record that a ticket was NOT fixed closes it anyway.
When the commit reaches the default branch the issue is closed as COMPLETED,
attributed to the commit author.

Two properties make it nearly undetectable by eye:

1. Closing keywords are INERT on non-default branches, so in a develop-to-main
   workflow the close fires when the release fast-forwards main, days after the
   commit was written, detached from anything anyone did that day.
2. In the timeline it is indistinguishable from a deliberate close.

It fired three times in this repository in one afternoon (#391, #414, #416), the
second and third AFTER the hazard had been filed as a ticket and written into the
project's memory, by the same author, using the same phrase. A convention that
its own author breaks twice within two hours of documenting it is not a control.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not ban closing keywords. Roughly twenty commits in
this repository use `Closes #N` correctly and deliberately, and banning those
would be wrong and would train people to bypass the hook, which is worse than not
having one. It keys on NEGATION: a phrase saying a ticket is not being fixed,
sitting immediately before its number.

TWO PRECISION RULES, both learned by this hook misfiring on its own development:

1. `git commit` must be INVOKED, not mentioned. The first version matched the
   substring anywhere, so it blocked a call that was writing DOCUMENTATION about
   this hook, and then blocked the edits to its own test file. A guard that fires
   on text about itself is noise, and noise is how a guard gets switched off.
2. When the message is passed with -m, only that is scanned. It is the text
   GitHub will read; the rest of the command line is not.

Fails OPEN on anything it cannot parse. A missed deferral note is a tracker
inaccuracy; a hook that wedges every commit in the repo is an outage.

    FAILS TOWARD SCANNING MORE, and review found out why the hard way. The narrowing was matching
    `-m "..."` with a backslash-escape rule, which is not the shape this project's commits take:
    the standard form here is `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF\n)"`, whose body contains RAW
    double quotes. The first one terminated the match, and everything after it, including the
    trailing deferral line, went unscanned. Measured on this repository: 19 of the last 30 commit
    bodies contain a quote character, and the deferral line is always last. So the hook would NOT
    have caught the real #416 commit, which is the incident it was written for.

    The precision that stopped the false positives is COMMIT_RE's invocation boundary, not this
    narrowing, so widening here costs nothing that was paid for. Narrow ONLY when the extraction
