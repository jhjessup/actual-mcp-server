# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Actual MCP Server** bridges AI assistants with [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), exposing **81 tools** for conversational financial management. Supports two transports: **HTTP** (for LibreChat/LobeChat/multi-user deployments) and **stdio** (for Claude Desktop/Claude Code local use; pass the `--stdio` flag).

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript (NodeNext/ESM), Node.js 22+, `@actual-app/api` v26, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, Express 5, Zod v4, Playwright

## Output Convention: never use em or en dashes

**Hard project rule. Applies to ALL output: chat, commits, GitHub comments and PR/issue bodies, file content, code comments, release notes.** Never write the unicode em dash character (U+2014) or en dash character (U+2013).

When you would have written one, restructure the sentence so no dash is needed at all. Do NOT substitute with a regular ASCII hyphen (the hyphen is reserved for genuine compound words like `post-merge`, `cherry-pick`, `off-budget`).

Replacement patterns:
- Introducing an explanation or list: use a colon. "Result: it shipped."
- Parenthetical aside: use commas or parentheses. "The fix, cherry-picked, landed cleanly." Or "The fix (cherry-picked) landed cleanly."
- Range: use the word "to" or "through". "v0.6.4 to v0.6.6", "Monday through Friday".
- Strong pause or contrast: split into two sentences.

Mechanical enforcement: a PreToolUse hook at `.claude/hooks/block-dashes.py` (forge-kit canonical `block-dashes-version: 1`, registered in `.claude/settings.local.json`) blocks any `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`, or `Bash` tool call whose payload contains an em or en dash, and tells the model how to restructure. The hook script's output is shown back to the model verbatim. Self-check before submitting tool calls regardless of whether the hook is currently armed.

Common slip patterns to watch for (described abstractly to avoid the literal characters):
- Tables that use a wide horizontal-bar punctuation as a separator inside cells (replace with a colon, or restructure into a sub-table).
- A definitional pause like `X PAUSE Y` where PAUSE is a wide horizontal bar (use `X: Y` instead).
- Range expressions like `X PAUSE Y` where PAUSE is a wide horizontal bar (use `X to Y`).
- Bulleted lists in the form `- item PAUSE description` where PAUSE is a wide horizontal bar (use `- item: description`).

## Git Workflow

**Always work on `develop`, never push directly to `main`.**

- All changes go to the `develop` branch
- Push to `origin/develop` after every commit
- `main` is only updated with explicit user permission (e.g. "push to main" or "release")
- When the user says "push to github" without specifying a branch → push to `develop`

**The `main` rule is enforced mechanically, not just by convention.** A `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook, `.claude/hooks/require_green_develop_before_main.py` (registered in `.claude/settings.local.json`), inspects every Bash command and BLOCKS any git merge, push, or release-tag push that targets `main` unless `origin/develop` is both version-bumped past the latest published `vX.Y.Z` tag and green in GitHub Actions at its HEAD sha. It fails CLOSED: if it cannot verify (no network, `gh` missing or unauthenticated, no CI run found), it blocks. Do not attempt to route around it; fix the underlying condition (bump the version, get CI green) or ask the user.

**A promotion to `main` REQUIRES a passing full integration run over BOTH transports (`MCP_TEST_TRANSPORT=http` and `MCP_TEST_TRANSPORT=stdio`) with a green zero-residue assertion.** Run `bash scripts/deploy-and-test.sh full`; it writes `.release/dual-transport-report.json`, which the `release` skill verifies against the develop HEAD sha. HTTP-only evidence is not sufficient: stdio is the transport half our Claude Desktop users run on, and it had no write-path coverage until #280.

**Incoming tickets are hypotheses, not ground truth.** For a `bug` or any
behaviour-change ticket (especially external or spec-derived ones), reproduce the
reported behaviour against the CURRENT code before writing a fix (the
`implement-ticket` skill's "Reproduce first" phase, ideally via `/local-env`). If
it does not reproduce, recharacterise or close it rather than fixing a phantom; if
it reproduces differently, rewrite and re-gate. A behaviour change is not done
until a check that was red is green. Test rigor (scenarios, unit + E2E tests) is
the maintainer's responsibility enforced by the gate, NOT something an external
reporter must provide: the issue templates ask reporters only for what they know.

**NEVER close a ticket without reading EVERY comment on it first.** Not the body,
not the comments you remember, not the ones you wrote: read the full thread at the
moment you close it, including anything added since you last looked. This applies
to closing by hand, closing as part of `/release` step 6, and closing as
superseded or not-planned.

The reason is specific. On #317 a reporter was asked whether their IdP's `sub`
matched Actual's `userId`. They answered four and a half hours before the ticket
was closed, the answer was "no, `userId` is an internally generated UUID", and the
close happened anyway without anyone reading it. That answer invalidated the whole
design: the feature shipped in v0.11.0 could never resolve a principal, and the
documentation actively recommended the broken setting. It cost a release, a
reopen, and #343. A reporter who answers a direct question and gets closed
unread will not answer the next one.

Practical form: `gh issue view <n> --json comments --jq '.comments[] | "[\(.author.login)] \(.createdAt)\n\(.body)"'`
before any `gh issue close`. If a comment postdates your last read, re-evaluate the
close rather than proceeding. Closing is cheap to defer and expensive to get wrong.

# Docker
docker compose --profile dev up         # Hot-reload dev (app on :3600)
docker compose --profile production up  # Production: MCP server on :3600
# docker-compose.yaml defines only the dev and production profiles (no nginx, no bundled Actual server).
# For a stack that also runs Actual Budget, use docker-compose.test.yaml (it + playwright.config.docker.ts back the test:e2e:docker* scripts).
```

**`npm run dev` is not a bare runner.** It is `npm run build && node scripts/register-tsconfig-paths.js -- --debug`, so it always recompiles first and always appends `--debug`. Anything you pass after `--` lands AFTER that flag, which is why the transport flag alone is enough. Passing `--debug` yourself is harmless but redundant. There is no watch mode: re-run the command to pick up a source change.

**The build is TypeScript 7 with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` on.** An unused import, local, or parameter is a hard `npm run build` failure, not a lint warning; prefix a deliberately-unused parameter with `_`. `tsconfig.json` also redirects `@actual-app/core` and `@actual-app/core/*` to the stub at `types/actual-core-stub.d.ts`. That stub is load-bearing: from `@actual-app/api` v26.4.0 the core package is imported directly and ships TypeScript SOURCE rather than compiled declarations, so without the redirect `tsc` compiles it under our `strict` settings and fails on code that needs `typescript-strict-plugin`. If you hit a type error pointing into `@actual-app/core`, the stub is the thing to look at, not the calling code. Note `types/` is in the do-not-modify tier below, so changing it needs explicit permission.

**Pre-commit mandatory**: `npm run build && npm run test:adapter && npm run test:unit-js && npm audit --audit-level=moderate`

**There is no `npm run lint`.** Do not go looking for one. CI's `Lint Code` job is `npm run build` (type check) plus `npm run typecheck:e2e`, `npm run check:coverage`, `npm run knip`, and `actionlint` (installed by `scripts/install-actionlint.sh`, which fetches the release tarball at a fixed URL and `sha256sum -c`s it against a COMMITTED digest BEFORE extracting; #328 removed the previous `curl | bash` of the upstream installer, which performs no verification of its own and pipes the tarball straight into `tar`. Run as `./actionlint -shellcheck= -color`; the shellcheck integration is disabled deliberately per #180 because its findings vary with the runner's shellcheck version. To bump, change `VERSION` and `SHA256` together, pinned as one set by invariant (q5)). The `Run Tests` job adds `npm run tool-count` and `npm audit` ahead of `test:unit-js`, and `Docker E2E Tests` runs `npm run test:e2e:docker:full`, not the smoke variant. Ignore the "63 tests" in that CI step's name (`ci-cd.yml`, `Run Docker E2E tests (FULL - 63 tests)`) and in the usage text of `tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh`: it is a stale label. `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` collects a number that moves with every tool added, and some of those skip themselves at runtime when a fixture is missing, so read it from `npx playwright test --list --config playwright.config.docker.ts --project docker-e2e-full` rather than from any prose. `npm run tool-count` polices TOOL totals, not test counts, so nothing keeps those two labels honest.

**The `ci-cd.yml` jobs beyond those three**, in file order, are `Version Generation` (feeds the others via `needs: version`), `Node Floor Guard (below-floor interpreter)`, `Validate Docker Description`, the per-platform `Build ${{ matrix.platform }} image` matrix, then the publish and post-publish lane: `Build & Publish Docker Images`, `Publish to npm`, `Verify Published Artifacts` (#326), `Train Liveness` (#327), `Security Scan`, `Update Docker Hub Description`, `Deployment Test`, `Create Release`, and `Pipeline Summary`. **Read the Node Floor Guard's log carefully before calling it a failure.** It deliberately installs Node 20, which is below the `engines` floor, then asserts that both `bin/actual-mcp-server.js` and `dist/src/index.js` exit 1 with a legible "requires Node" message instead of the raw `ERR_IMPORT_ASSERTION_TYPE_MISSING` crash (#275), and that the dist entry writes nothing to stdout so stdio framing stays clean. A passing run therefore prints a below-floor Node version and a rejection message. That output is the assertion succeeding. The job exists because every other job runs on a supported Node, where the guard is a no-op and could rot unnoticed.

**There are six workflows in `.github/workflows/`**, and the doc above only names some of them inline:

| Workflow | Role |
|----------|------|
| `ci-cd.yml` | The main pipeline (the jobs described above) |
| `dependency-update.yml` | `Dependency Update & Auto-Release`: the scheduled `@actual-app/api` release train, plus a `report-train-failure` job |
| `api-surface-drift.yml` | The NON-BLOCKING lane that reports live `@actual-app/api` surface drift. It exists precisely so the unit suite can stay hermetic (#321); do not make it blocking, that is the failure mode it was built to remove |
| `template-lockstep.yml` | Runs `scripts/check-template-lockstep.sh` to keep the four issue templates and `docs/guides/ticket-standards.md` on one `template-version` marker |
| `unraid-xmllint.yml` | Validates `unraid/actual-mcp-server.xml` |
| `copilot-setup-steps.yml` | Environment bootstrap for the GitHub Copilot coding agent; not a gate |

**Do NOT run in ephemeral environments**: `test:e2e`, `test:integration:*`, `dev`/`start` (need real `.env`), `release:*`/`docs:sync` (human responsibility only), `deploy:*` (needs Docker). `test:integration:cleanup` deletes test data created by `full`. Only run it after `full` against a test budget.

**Integration test modules** (`tests/manual/tests/`): `sanity` (read-only protocol), `smoke` (balances/categories), `account`, `category-group`, `category`, `payee`, `transaction`, `budget`, `notes`, `rules`, `schedule`, `batch_uncategorized_rules_upsert`, `entrypoint`, `advanced` (bank sync, raw SQL).

**Shared test infrastructure** lives in `tests/shared/`: `mcp-protocol.js` (JSON-RPC framing helpers used by the manual runner) and `e2e-helpers.ts` (used by the Playwright specs). Beyond the two "all tools" specs, `tests/e2e/` also holds `docker.e2e.spec.ts` (the smoke project) and `mcp-client.playwright.spec.ts` (protocol compliance, host config only). **Every executed E2E assertion over the tool surface lives in `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts`, and since #383 it runs over BOTH transports**: the `docker-e2e-full` project over HTTP inside the runner container, then `docker-e2e-full-stdio` over stdio. One file, two projects, because #375 collapsed 154 direct call sites into a single fixture, so the transport is a fixture implementation rather than a second copy of the suite.

**The stdio project runs on the HOST, not in the runner container**, and that is forced rather than stylistic: `e2e-test-runner` mounts only `tests/`, the config and the two package files, so it has neither the server's `dist/` nor a docker socket and no route to a stdio server. `tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh` therefore invokes it directly (step 6b) after the containerised HTTP run, while the stack is still up, reaching the server by `docker exec` exactly as `tests/manual/mcp-client-stdio.js` does. Three things about that path bit during implementation and are commented where they live: the E2E image's root filesystem is READ-ONLY so the stdio cache needs its own named volume (`mcp-test-stdio-data`, never a subdirectory of the HTTP server's `/app/data`), a fresh volume mounts ROOT-owned so it must be chowned to uid 1001, and `ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` is exported by the compose ENTRYPOINT from `/tmp/actual-sync-id.txt` rather than being in the container's configured env, so `docker exec` does not inherit it and must repeat the read. Each of those failed the whole stdio project in about 40ms per test while HTTP stayed green.

**The stdio leg is OPT-IN and OFF in CI until #423.** #383 landed the infrastructure (fixture, host-side client, project, named volume), but the leg is not yet CI-clean, so `run-docker-e2e.sh` step 6b runs ONLY when `RUN_STDIO_E2E=true`, which CI does not set. Two things block it, both tracked in #423: on a strict Playwright it errors at startup with `HTML reporter output folder clashes with the tests output folder` (the shared docker config nests the HTML report inside `test-results`), and #422 left a rate-limit tail on the write-heavy block (a throttled `api.sync()` closes the budget, a #396-class close-before-load, forcing a re-download and a re-login that `withAuthRetry` backs off 25s and then fails). The pacer cannot prevent the tail: the host-side leg never reaches the call budget (it holds the pacer zero times while HTTP holds it a dozen or more), so the overflow is request amplification, not call rate. Run it locally with `RUN_STDIO_E2E=true` (ADVISORY unless `STDIO_E2E_GATING=true`). #423 fixes both blockers, turns it on in CI, and makes it gating.

Four tests are HTTP-only, each with the reason at the test: the two `actual_session_*` tools (stdio has one implicit session, so there is nothing to list or expire), and the two that read the raw JSON-RPC envelope through `mcp.post` (the SDK surfaces a tool error as an exception instead). So the stdio project skips exactly those four: read the totals from `npx playwright test --list` rather than pinning them (the stdio project collects the same set as the HTTP one and skips exactly those four). The transports run SEQUENTIALLY because both drive the one Actual server, whose 500-requests-per-minute limiter counts their calls together, and the E2E wall clock roughly doubles. **The pacer does NOT span the two legs.** `pace()` in `tests/shared/e2e-helpers.ts` is module scoped, so it shares one window only WITHIN a process, and the two legs are SEPARATE processes (HTTP inside the runner container, stdio on the host). Each leg paces itself; the 75s cool-down in `run-docker-e2e.sh` (`STDIO_COOLDOWN_S`) is what drains Actual's window between them, and it is not optional: an earlier version claimed the legs shared a window, and CI proved otherwise (the stdio leg's first login refused with "Too many requests", 39 worker restarts, 377 errors from one refusal). The reason the leg itself now fits under the ceiling is #419: since v0.16.13 a stdio process logs in ONCE and keeps the singleton alive, so ~100 tool calls are ~2 requests each rather than a full init/download/op/sync per call. stdio is additionally covered by the dual-transport gate (#280) and the framing check (#323).

**An uncollected spec file is silently inert, and this repo was caught by that twice.** #366 removed `tests/e2e/suites/*.ts` (nothing imported them, no `testMatch` covered them), and #382 then found `tests/e2e/stdio.spec.ts` in the same state: three real tests that had never executed once since the day they were added, while this very paragraph described the file as live coverage. Its assertions now live in `tests/unit/entrypoint_invariants.test.js`, where they are blocking, and the file is gone.

**`tests/unit/e2e_spec_collection.test.js` is the guard that makes this fail loudly now** (#382, extended by #384). It cross-checks every `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` against both configs' `testMatch` patterns and names any file no project collects. It exists because nothing else can catch this class: Playwright documents no mechanism for reporting an uncollected spec and does not warn, and `knip.json` declares `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` as an ENTRY pattern, so the blocking dead-code gate treats every spec as a reachable root by definition.

**COLLECTED IS NOT RUN, and #384 is that distinction.** A project existing in a config proves nothing: `mcp-protocol-tests` and `docker-e2e-smoke` are both real projects that CI never selects, because both workflows invoke `test:e2e:docker:full`, which selects `docker-e2e-full` and therefore only `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts`. Had #382 been "fixed" by adding a `stdio-tests` project rather than by moving its assertions into the unit chain, the guard would have gone green while the file still ran nowhere, which is the same defect one level up with a guard certifying it. So the guard now follows the whole chain, workflow to `run-docker-e2e.sh` to project to `testMatch`, and requires every spec to either run in CI or carry a `DECLARED_MANUAL` entry stating what it is for and where its coverage actually lives. **`mcp-client.playwright.spec.ts` and `docker.e2e.spec.ts` are both declared manual**: their round-trip and smoke assertions are subsets of `docker-all-tools`, the expired-session shim is covered by `tests/unit/httpServer_session_not_found.test.js`, and only the SSE connect is unique to the former. The chain is parsed from that ONE shell script rather than from workflow YAML deliberately: coupling this test to job names would be brittle, and the script is the narrow waist where the truth actually lives.

So: add E2E coverage to `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts`, and confirm it is collected with `npx playwright test --list --config playwright.config.docker.ts`. If you add a spec file and a project to match it, the guard stays quiet; if you add only the file, it fails and tells you so.

**Write a new E2E test against `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts` (#375), never against a shared context.** That module exports an extended Playwright `test` whose fixtures each PROVISION what they hand back and remove it in teardown, even when the test fails: `mcp` (a bound client: `call` unwraps the envelope, `raw` keeps it, `post` sends arbitrary JSON-RPC), plus `makeAccount`, `makeCategoryGroup`, `makeCategory`, `makePayee`, `makeTransaction`, `makeRule` and `makeSchedule`. Ask for what the test needs (`async ({ mcp, makeAccount }) => ...`) and it can be run alone with `--grep`. Deletes have a required order, so all factories share ONE `cleanup` registry sorted by `CLEANUP_ORDER` (transactions, rules, schedules, payees, categories, groups, accounts) rather than relying on Playwright's reverse-setup unwind, which follows the order the TEST declared its fixtures. Register anything a factory does not own (a tag, a note) with `cleanup.add(...)` yourself. The spec previously shared one mutable `testContext` behind 49 `test.skip()` guards. That coupling produced at least a dozen tests that passed for the wrong reason (an account deleted mid-run, a filter called with a key the schema strips so it scanned the whole budget, `.find()` on a response envelope that is not an array), and the reason is recorded inline at each one. `npm run typecheck:e2e` covers this directory, which the root `tsconfig` does not.

## Project-Local Agents & Commands

Five **project-specific** subagents live in `.claude/agents/`. Delegate to them via the Agent tool for complex tasks in their domain:

| Agent | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `tool-author` | Adding a new MCP tool end-to-end (file, registration, adapter, tests, docs) |
| `qa` | Writing, reviewing, or debugging tests at any layer (unit, integration, E2E, manual) |
| `release-manager` | Version bumps, docs sync, GitHub issue triage, closing fixed tickets |
| `actual-api` | Questions about `@actual-app/api` behaviour, field names, quirks, `withActualApi` lifecycle |
| `ticket-gate` | Readiness gate for GitHub issues (forge-kit ticket-gate v1). Runs 6 core specialist agents (tool-author, qa, release-manager, actual-api, security-auditor, architect-review) to score a ticket before implementation (all must score 10/10; an agent whose domain the ticket does not touch auto-scores 10 N/A) |

Additional generic agents from forge-kit governance also live alongside them (`architect-review`, `code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`, `coding-standards-auditor`, `security-auditor`, `backend-security-coder`, `api-security-tester`, `performance-engineer`, `test-automator`, `tdd-orchestrator`, `dep-auditor`, `code-health-auditor`, `health-check`). Use these for cross-cutting reviews; prefer the project-specific agents above whenever the task is in their domain. (`dep-auditor` owns dependency health; `code-health-auditor` (#234) owns source dead code and doc-to-code drift; `api-security-tester` runs read-only security probes against a LOCAL instance only.)

Project-local slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

- `/implement-ticket <issue-number>`: the end-to-end pipeline for a GitHub issue (gate to 10/10, implement, validate, code review, commit + patch bump + push to `develop`). Stops at `develop` by design.
- `/merge-pr <pr-number>`: never merges a PR directly. Files a gate-ready ticket to reimplement the change on `develop`, runs it through `/implement-ticket`, then closes the PR as superseded.
- `/release`: the ONLY sanctioned path to `main`. Fast-forwards `main` to `develop`, tags, verifies the publish pipeline, and closes the tickets the release ships.

- `/dep-auditor [--full]`: DEPENDENCY health audit. Runs Knip (unused deps), npm registry health, `npm audit`, and version drift checks, then opens GitHub issues for findings (cache-first; `--full` re-audits everything).
- `/code-health-auditor [--full] [--dry-run]`: SOURCE code-health audit (#234). Runs the committed Knip config (dead files/exports/types) plus the doc-to-code drift guards, triages against the documented allowlist, and opens gate-ready tickets for genuine findings (cache-first via `docs/audit/deadcode-audit-cache.json`). Run MANUALLY; no scheduling. Complements `/dep-auditor` (it owns deps, this owns source).
- `/local-env`: full local deployment pipeline for the dev environment.
- `/gate-ticket <issue-number>`: runs the ticket readiness gate on a GitHub issue (all 6 core specialist agents must score 10/10 before implementation; a non-touched domain auto-scores 10 N/A).
- `/ci-health`: checks all GitHub Actions workflows for failures, opens P0 tickets, and auto-fixes safe failures.
- `/full-review [target]`: orchestrates a multi-dimensional code review (architecture, security, performance, testing, best practices).
- `/pr-enhance [PR# or description]`: enhances an existing pull request (description, labels, follow-ups).

Project-local skills in `.claude/skills/` (invoked via the Skill tool, or automatically when their trigger phrases appear):

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `implement-ticket`, `merge-pr`, `release` | The workflow bodies behind the same-named slash commands above |
| `api-design-principles` | Consistency rules for the 81-tool MCP surface; read before adding or revising a tool schema |
| `owasp-api-security` | Security test patterns for the MCP transport (pairs with the `api-security-tester` agent) |
| `fork-analysis` | Harvests feature ideas from forks/branches into gate-ready tickets; caches results in `docs/audit/FORK_ANALYSIS.md` |
| `release-automation` | Governs the CI release gate (no main promotion without a version bump) and the auto-release lanes |
| `working-overnight` | Governed unattended work: branch plus PR only, never merges, writes a morning report |

### Registered hooks

All five live in `.claude/hooks/` and are registered in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Two are described in detail elsewhere in this file; the other three are easy to be surprised by:

| Hook | Event | Notes |

## Issue Labels

Every issue carries at least one **area** label (`backend`, `infrastructure`, `security`, `actual-api`, `documentation`; the gate enforces this) and one **priority** label: `P0` (Critical), `P1` (High), `P2` (Medium), `P3` (Low). Speculative, not-yet-committed ideas also get `icebox`. Apply the priority label on triage so the backlog is filterable: `gh issue list --label P1`. The feature and infrastructure issue templates have a Priority dropdown whose selection should be mirrored to the matching label.

**Canonical ready-ticket standard: `docs/guides/ticket-standards.md`.** That doc is the single source of truth for what a ready work ticket must contain; the four work issue templates (`bug`, `feature_request`, `infrastructure`, `security`) collect it, the `ticket-gate` agent scores against it, and `scripts/check-template-lockstep.sh` (CI: `.github/workflows/template-lockstep.yml`) keeps the templates and that doc on one shared `<!-- template-version: N -->` marker so they cannot silently drift.

## Architecture

### Layered Design

```
AI Client (LibreChat/LobeChat)       Claude Desktop / Claude Code
    ↓ HTTP/MCP JSON-RPC                   ↓ stdin/stdout JSON-RPC
Express + StreamableHTTP             StdioServerTransport
(src/server/httpServer.ts)           (src/server/stdioServer.ts)
    ↓                                     ↓
ActualMCPConnection (src/lib/ActualMCPConnection.ts)
    ↓
ActualToolsManager (81 tools, Zod validation, dispatch) at src/actualToolsManager.ts
    ↓
actual-adapter.ts (withActualApi wrapper, retry 3x, concurrency limit 5)
    ↓
@actual-app/api v26 → Actual Budget Server
```

**Transport is selected via CLI flag** (`--http` or `--stdio`); they are mutually exclusive. The `--stdio` flag sets `MCP_STDIO_MODE=true` **before** importing the logger so that all log output is routed to stderr (stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC framing).

### Critical Pattern: `withActualApi` Wrapper

**Every Actual API operation MUST use `withActualApi()`** from `src/lib/actual-adapter.ts`. Two execution modes since #134 (v0.6.4):

- **Pooled mode (preferred, fires automatically when an MCP session is active):** if `requestContext` carries a `sessionId` AND `connectionPool.hasConnection(sessionId)` is true AND `apiState.isApiInitialized()` is true, the wrapper skips `api.init()` / `api.shutdown()` entirely and runs the operation against the existing per-session connection. This eliminates the per-op upstream-login burst that was the root cause of #127. Writes still call `api.sync()` afterward to commit.
- **Legacy mode (fallback):** when there's no sessionId in context, no pool entry, or the api singleton was torn down by another path, the wrapper falls back to the original `init` → `op` → `shutdown` cycle so non-MCP callers (CLI scripts, startup health checks, stdio without `requestContext.run`) keep working.

**stdio takes the legacy branch but does NOT re-login per call (#419).** stdio never gets a pool entry (that is deliberate: `transport: 'stdio'` keeps it off the pooled path because a pooled stdio entry would never be `touch()`ed, so it would expire and be swept), so every stdio op runs the legacy branch. But a stdio PROCESS is one long-lived single-user session for its whole lifetime, so `shutdownActualApi` keeps the api singleton alive between ops instead of tearing it down: `_shouldKeepSingletonAlive(activeSessions, forceFullShutdown)` returns true when `activeSessions > 0` (HTTP owns it) OR when `MCP_STDIO_MODE === 'true'` and no infrastructure error forced a teardown. The next op's `init` then no-ops (it short-circuits on `isApiInitialized()` and still runs `ensureLoadedBudgetMatchesSession`), so N stdio calls cost ONE upstream login rather than N. The signal is the PROCESS flag, never the ambient request context: the write drain calls `shutdownActualApi` outside the per-op `requestContext.run`, in a context that belongs to an unrelated enqueuer (the #390 trap). The self-heal that the always-full-shutdown path used to give for free is preserved by `forceFullShutdown`: on a `_shouldDropPoolOnError`-classified error the legacy read branch, write branch, and write drain (both its success and fatal shutdown sites) force a full teardown so the next op re-inits fresh; `forceFullShutdown` defeats ONLY the stdio keep-alive, never the active-HTTP-session keep-alive. HTTP behaviour is unchanged when `MCP_STDIO_MODE` is unset.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
await withActualApi(async () => { return await rawAddTransactions(data); });

// ❌ WRONG: data won't persist (tombstone issue) and bypasses pool cooperation
await rawAddTransactions(data);
```

**Never nest one session inside another: it deadlocks.** Both modes run the operation inside `withApiLock` (`src/lib/apiLock.ts`), which is NOT reentrant. Since #391 it is an explicit waiter QUEUE with BUDGET AFFINITY rather than the strict FIFO chained-promise mutex it was: on release it prefers the oldest waiter whose budget is already loaded, so a run of same-budget work pays ONE re-selection instead of one per call (measured on a contended alternating load: 19 downloads to 2). Three properties keep that safe and each has a mutation-proven test in `tests/unit/api_lock_affinity.test.js`: starvation is bounded at `MAX_AFFINITY_SKIPS` consecutive head-skips, ordering WITHIN a budget stays FIFO, and an UNHINTED waiter is a BARRIER affinity may not cross (without that, the write drain, the pool's session open and `shutdownAll` were all freely skipped, and on a single-budget deployment the feature was inert as an optimisation while still reordering writes behind reads). The release path grants before it logs, and wraps the log, because `grantNext` runs in a `finally` and anything that throws there leaves the lock held with a queue nobody will ever be handed: #278's shape, which no timeout can rescue. An inner session takes the outer call's own release promise as the lock it waits on, and that release cannot fire until the outer callback resolves, so the inner call never settles on its own. **What you actually observe is a ~30s stall followed by `Actual API operation timed out after 30000ms (ACTUAL_OP_TIMEOUT_MS)`**, because #270 wraps each operation body in `withOpTimeout` INSIDE the lock, and that race is what breaks the deadlock. Read that timeout as a probable nesting bug, not as a slow upstream server. One caveat: setting `ACTUAL_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` to exactly `0` makes `withOpTimeout` a pass-through (`opTimeout.ts`), which restores the hangs-forever behaviour. The Zod transform in `config.ts` sanitises most bad input first: a negative value or one with no leading digit falls back to 30000, 1 to 249 is clamped up to 250, and anything above 2147483647 is clamped DOWN to it, because a larger delay overflows `setTimeout` and silently becomes 1ms, which would time out every operation. It is `parseInt`-based though, so it truncates rather than rejects: `0.5` becomes `0` and disables the bound, while `30s` becomes 250 rather than 30000. If you are chasing a hang, read the configured value as `parseInt` sees it. Note also that the protection is per-call-site rather than structural: every `withApiLock` body currently wraps its operation in `withOpTimeout`, but nothing enforces that, so a future acquisition site added without one would deadlock silently (compare #278's lost wakeup, where the absence of an error was the only tell).

So a tool must never wrap an `adapter.*` call in a session of its own, and code already inside a session callback must reach the API through the raw functions, not back through `adapter.*`. Exactly ONE tool file statically imports `@actual-app/api`:

- `budget_updates_batch.ts`: `raw*` calls inside `adapter.batchBudgetUpdates(...)`. Not a read plus write; it is a batch of pure writes, and it predates #142 as the original fix for exactly the nesting hazard above. Its in-code comment says so ("Use raw API calls directly to avoid nested queueing/deadlock").

**Where a read-then-write guard belongs: the ADAPTER, always (#371, #376).** A guard in the tool layer has to reach past `adapter.*` for its reads, which means the reads lose `retry`, the observability call site is bypassed, and, worst, the corresponding `adapter.*` method is left reachable with NO guard for the next caller to find. `adapter.deleteRule` was in exactly that state: callerless, and calling it directly silently failed to delete a schedule-owned rule, which is the #355 defect the tool had already fixed.

The single-cycle property never required the raw api. `queueWriteOperation` holds the api lock for its whole body, so a read, a decision and a write inside ONE call to it are one cycle, which is what `adapter.closeAccount`, `reopenAccount`, `mergePayees`, `deletePayee`, `deleteRule`, `deleteCategoryGroup`, `deleteSchedule`, `updateNote` and `upsertRule` all do.

**Read that property precisely, because it used to be weaker than it sounds (#378).** The api lock makes a drain atomic against OTHER DRAINS. Until #378 it did NOT make an operation atomic against its SIBLINGS in the same drain: `processWriteQueue` dispatched the whole batch with `Promise.allSettled`, so two ops in one batch interleaved freely. Every guard migrated by #371 and #376 quietly assumed otherwise. Reproduced before the fix: an `actual_payees_delete` and an `actual_payees_update` of the SAME payee, issued as parallel tool calls, land in one drain; the update's pre-read saw the payee, the guard passed, and `rawUpdatePayee` then ran against a row the sibling had removed, which is the phantom partial row the guard exists to prevent. It reproduced at every timing tested, including a zero-delay delete. **The batch now dispatches SEQUENTIALLY, in enqueue order**, which is what makes read-decide-write actually hold. Do not restore the concurrent dispatch: the ops all target one in-process SQLite through a single api singleton, so they contend rather than overlap, and it turns `tests/unit/adapter_drain_listing_cache.test.js` red across its create-then-update, delete-then-update and ordering cases if you do. (A COUNT is deliberately not quoted here: two copies of one already drifted within this ticket, first nine then ten while the truth was eleven, because adding a case changes it. Name the cases, not the number.)

**Adding the 23rd guarded write method: two things to get right (#378).** First, the pre-read is safe against a SIBLING operation only because the batch dispatches sequentially; that is the property, not an implementation detail, and it is what lets a read, a decision and a write in one `queueWriteOperation` actually hold. Second, decide whether your method can change any of the four entity listings and annotate accordingly. Say nothing and you get the fail-safe default (every listing dropped after your op), which costs one listing and can never be wrong. Only claim `preservesListings` when the write lands in its OWN table, and check upstream rather than assuming: `deleteAccount` and `closeAccount` can remove an account's transfer payee, `updateAccount` renaming an account renames that payee so the listing's CONTENT changes even though its id set does not, `deleteCategoryGroup` takes its categories with it, and every transaction write can mint a payee by two routes. The methods that legitimately claim it today are notes, the budget-amount family, tags, rules and schedules.

**The guard pre-reads are memoised per drain (#378).** A drain opens a listing cache for `accounts`, `categories`, `categoryGroups` and `payees` in an `AsyncLocalStorage` that exists only inside the drain's own `run()`, so it cannot outlive one drain, be shared across sessions, or survive a fatal error. That scoping is deliberately STRUCTURAL rather than conventional: the first version used a module-level variable cleared in a `finally`, which was unreachable from outside a drain only by argument (every call site happens to sit inside a `queueWriteOperation` body), and the bug that argument would eventually permit is one principal's guard reading another principal's entity list. Note the separate hazard it does NOT address: two sessions writing inside one drain window share the drain itself, because the connection is chosen from `batch[0]`. That is #390. The scope is not a tuning choice: anything wider would serve one session's data to another, which is a disclosure bug rather than a staleness bug. Invalidation is fail-safe by construction: after each operation, every listing is dropped EXCEPT those the operation explicitly declared it cannot change, via `queueWriteOperation(fn, { preservesListings: [...] })`. So forgetting to annotate a new write method costs one extra listing, while wrongly claiming preservation would cause a false not-found. Never invert that default. Which methods claim it is listed in the paragraph above rather than counted here, for the same reason the count was dropped two paragraphs up. Measured effect for a 50-op batch: transaction creates and `setBudgetAmount` each drop from 50 listings to 1, while 50 payee updates stay at 50, because a payee update genuinely changes the payee listing and invalidation is mandatory there. The two post-write verification reads in `closeAccount` and `reopenAccount` deliberately bypass the cache: a verification that reads its own pre-write snapshot is vacuous.

Eight tools carried a guard in the tool layer and none do now: `accounts_close`, `accounts_reopen`, `budgets_holdForNextMonth` (#371, from #355/#357/#358), then `rules_delete`, `category_groups_delete`, `schedules_delete`, `rules_create_or_update` and `notes_update` (#376). `notes_update` was the expensive one: four `adapter.get*` calls plus a write meant FIVE api lock cycles for one operation, and `Promise.all` only made it look concurrent, because the api mutex is process-global.

The tests for these tools all needed the same seam change, which is worth knowing before you write one: stubbing `adapter.withWriteSession` as a pass-through stubs away the guard itself once the guard lives in the adapter. Use `_setSkipApiInitForTests(true)` with the RAW api functions stubbed BEFORE the adapter import (it destructures them at module load), and assert the single-cycle property with the witness in `tests/unit/helpers/write-cycle.mjs`.

**Do NOT assert it with a bare `_getWriteQueueBatchCountForTests()` delta** (#376). That counter increments once per dispatched drain, so a delta of 1 proves only that ONE DRAIN HAPPENED. It stays green when the guard's READ moves back out of `queueWriteOperation`, which is precisely the regression that would undo the single-snapshot property these migrations exist to create. Eight tests asserted it that way and none of them could detect their own feature being reverted. The witness samples the counter from INSIDE the raw read and write stubs instead, so it can tell a read in the drain (`readAt === writeAt`) from one before it (`readAt === writeAt - 1`), and it fails closed if a stub is not wired up.

`transactions_summary_by_payee.ts` and `transactions_summary_by_category.ts` are NOT this pattern and will not show up in a `from '@actual-app/api'` grep: they `await import('@actual-app/api')` inside the handler purely to get the `q()` ActualQL query builder, then hand the built query to `adapter.runQuery()`, which opens the one session.

The pool branch only releases its session connection on **infrastructure-level errors**. Since #177, `_shouldDropPoolOnError` in `actual-adapter.ts` has been a one-line delegation to `isRetryableError` in `src/lib/retry.ts`, so the retry decision and the pool-drop decision share ONE source of truth (`TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERNS`) and cannot drift apart. Do not reintroduce a second list. The patterns are `Authentication failed`, `ECONNRESET`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `socket hang up`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `out of memory`, `ENOMEM`, and `timed out`. That last one is #270's own timeout message: classing it transient drops the pooled connection so the next call re-inits cleanly, and it causes no retry storm because `withOpTimeout` rejects OUTSIDE any `retry()`. Anything not matching (Zod failures, "field does not exist", "not found", and every unknown error) is terminal: it is never retried, and it leaves the pool entry intact so the next call can reuse it.

### Tool Structure Pattern

New tools should use `createTool()` from `src/lib/toolFactory.ts`. It wires up error handling, logging, and observability automatically:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { createTool } from '../lib/toolFactory.js';
import { CommonSchemas } from '../lib/schemas/common.js';
import adapter from '../lib/actual-adapter.js';

export default createTool({
  name: 'actual_domain_action',      // naming: actual_{domain}_{action}
  description: '...',
  schema: z.object({
    account: CommonSchemas.accountId,
    amount: CommonSchemas.amountCents, // always in cents, integer
    date: CommonSchemas.date,          // YYYY-MM-DD
  }),
  handler: async (input) => {
    return await adapter.someMethod(input);
  },
  examples: [                          // optional but recommended
    { description: 'Example use case', input: { account: 'uuid', amount: 5000, date: '2024-01-15' } },
  ],
});
```

Many existing tools still use the older pattern. Both work, but `createTool()` is preferred for new tools:

```typescript
// Legacy pattern (most existing tools)
import type { ToolDefinition } from '../../types/tool.d.js';
const InputSchema = z.object({ ... });
const tool: ToolDefinition = {
  name: 'actual_domain_action',
  description: '...',
  inputSchema: InputSchema,
  call: async (args: unknown) => {
    const input = InputSchema.parse(args);
    return await adapter.someMethod(input);
  },
};
export default tool;
```

**Every tool declares MCP annotations, and they are HINTS, never a guard (#379).** `src/lib/tool-annotations.ts` classifies all 81 tools on the four fields the MCP spec defines, and `src/lib/tool-list-entry.ts` attaches them to every `tools/list` entry. Two things to know before touching this:

- **The spec's defaults are the conservative ones**, so declaring nothing already means write-capable, destructive and open-world. The value is telling clients which tools are SAFE, and correcting `openWorldHint`, whose default (`true`) is wrong for every tool but one: this server's domain is one Actual instance, a CLOSED world, and only `actual_bank_sync` reaches a third party.
- **Nothing in `src/` may branch on an annotation.** The spec says clients must treat them as untrusted, so they can never carry an authorisation or safety decision. Authorisation stays in `budget-acl.ts`; refusal stays in the adapter guards. An annotation that lies is worse than none, which is why `tests/unit/tool_annotations.test.js` derives the classification from the adapter call graph and fails if a `readOnlyHint: true` tool reaches `queueWriteOperation`. That guard also replaced #370's hand-maintained `READ_ONLY` list, so "can this tool write?" now has ONE answer.

Four tools mutate WITHOUT the write queue, so the call graph says read and reality says write: `bank_sync` (imports transactions through the read path), `budgets_export` (writes a zip), `budgets_switch` (session state plus a stored preference) and `session_close` (a pooled connection). They are excluded from the read-only set and listed with their reasons in the guard.

**`tools/list` is built in ONE place: `buildToolListEntries`.** It used to be assembled independently in FOUR (the HTTP SDK handler, the no-session LobeChat compatibility path, the expired-session LobeChat discovery shim, and the stdio handler), so anything added to the published surface reached some clients and not others. #379 found this twice over: the first attempt patched a fifth site that is not `tools/list` at all and shipped nothing, and the second missed the expired-session shim, which would have served stale-session clients the whole tool surface with no annotations, falling back to the spec's defaults and presenting every read-only tool as a destructive open-world write. `tests/unit/httpServer_session_not_found.test.js` now fails if a payload is assembled inline again.

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create `src/tools/new_tool.ts` using the pattern above
2. Export it from `src/tools/index.ts` (e.g. `export { default as new_tool } from './new_tool.js';`). Despite the "Auto-generated index" header on that file, exports are added manually; no script regenerates it.
3. Add tool name to `IMPLEMENTED_TOOLS` array in `src/actualToolsManager.ts`
4. Add unit tests in `tests/unit/` (positive + negative cases)
5. Run `npm run verify-tools` to confirm registration
6. Bump the `EXPECTED_TOOL_COUNT` default in `tests/manual/tests/sanity.js`, which is the ONLY place that asserts an exact tool count, then run `npm run tool-count -- --fix` for the prose totals. Neither e2e spec carries an `EXPECTED_TOOL_COUNT`: `mcp-client.playwright.spec.ts` only asserts `tools.length > 0`, and the number in `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` is a cosmetic `describe(...)` label plus a header comment. Add a happy-path call to `tests/e2e/docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` (the only E2E file that runs; verify with `npx playwright test --list --config playwright.config.docker.ts`)
7. See `docs/NEW_TOOL_CHECKLIST.md` for the full 9-step checklist (includes doc sync, integration test entry, manual-prompt update)

**Logging (structured, since #219)**: use `createModuleLogger('MODULE')` from `src/lib/loggerFactory.js`; never call `console.*` directly in source (the console is hijacked to winston for stdio framing safety). Pass structured context as the metadata object (`log.info('did x', { sessionId, count })`), not interpolated into the message, so it is queryable. Levels: `error` (a failure needing attention), `warn` (recoverable/suspicious), `info` (normal lifecycle), `debug` (developer internals). Output format is resolved in `src/logger.ts` straight from `process.env` (it loads before `config.ts`): `LOG_FORMAT=json|pretty`, precedence explicit `LOG_FORMAT` > `NODE_ENV=production` (json) > pretty. JSON records carry `{ timestamp, level, service, module, message, stack?, sessionId?, requestId?, context }`. The `sessionId`/`requestId` correlation fields (#221) are stamped automatically from `requestContext` on every line within an HTTP request (an inbound `X-Correlation-ID` header is honored, else a UUID is generated); they are reserved top-level fields, so do not pass `sessionId`/`requestId` as your own metadata (the request value wins). The format helpers `resolveLogConfig` / `buildLogFormat` are exported and unit-tested in `tests/unit/logger_structured.test.js`. Secrets are redacted centrally (#220): a `redactSecrets` winston format (in `buildLogFormat`, after `splat()`) masks sensitive metadata at any depth, plus the actual configured secret values (`MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION`, `ACTUAL_PASSWORD`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_SECRET`), to `[REDACTED]`. The matcher is `isSensitiveKey` in `src/logger.ts` and has two parts: an exact-name `SENSITIVE_KEYS` set (`authorization`, `proxy-authorization`, `token`, `password`, `encryptionpassword`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `secret`, `apikey`, `api_key`, `x-api-key`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_secret`), and a pattern fallback for any lowercased key ENDING in `password`, `secret`, or `token`, or CONTAINING `authorization` or `cookie`. Still avoid logging secrets deliberately, but the central format is the backstop. To protect a new sensitive field, name it with one of those three suffixes or add it to `SENSITIVE_KEYS`.

**Unit tests must be hermetic about the `@actual-app/api` surface (#321).** No file under `tests/unit/` may enumerate the LIVE `@actual-app/api` module's exported keys (the `Object.keys(<the imported module>)` shape) to build a coverage or gap assertion. Such a test's result changes with no commit: `check_coverage.test.js` asserted the genuine-gaps bucket was empty against the live surface, 26.8.0 added `exportBudget`, `getPreferences` and `importBudget`, and the auto-release train died for two nights while security PR #319 stayed blocked behind the same red test. Use the `FROZEN_API_SURFACE` fixture in `check_coverage.test.js` instead, which is updated only by a deliberate human commit and is never regenerated from `node_modules`.

The rule is scoped to ENUMERATION, deliberately. Importing the package to monkeypatch it for mocking is correct and is what 20 existing unit tests do; do not read this as a ban on the import. Enforced by `tests/unit/unit_chain_membership.test.js`, which also guards that every `tests/unit/*.test.js` appears in the hand-maintained `test:unit-js` chain (there is no glob, so an unlisted file silently never runs, and two were already orphaned that way). Live-surface drift is reported by the separate `api-surface-drift` lane, which is non-blocking by construction.

**The release train has six pre-flight controls (#324)**, in `scripts/train-preflight.mjs`, evaluated in a pinned order: validity, equality, prerelease, direction, denylist, soak. Order is load bearing and unit-tested. Notes that are easy to get wrong: `sort -V` is NOT a semver comparator (it ranks `26.8.0-alpha.1` ABOVE `26.8.0`), and an empty `LATEST` makes a sort-based direction check report a quiet "refusing to downgrade" rather than failing, which is why validity runs first and is the only control whose disposition is a RED run. `.github/actual-api-denylist.txt` makes a rollback stick, and **only its copy on `main` has any effect** because the train checks out `ref: main`. The soak window defaults to 24h since #440 (it was 48h) and is clamped at BOTH ends (`SOAK_FLOOR_HOURS = 24`, `SOAK_CEILING_HOURS = 168`). Do not confuse that constant with `STALE_THRESHOLD_HOURS = 48` in `report-train-stale.mjs`, which is still 48, is the #327 liveness threshold, and encodes "tolerates exactly one missed nightly cron": the two share a number and nothing else, and #440's original body nearly had both changed by instructing a sweep for the literal. The floor buys a third rather than a half, because the train is NIGHTLY: the real lag is the floor plus up to one cron interval, so the worst case moved from (48,72]h to (24,48]h, because clamping only the floor left the one direction that disables the train silently: a fat-fingered `4800` instead of `48` makes every run report `soaking`, which maps to `ignore`, so the train is off for six months and nobody is told. It also fails closed when the publish timestamp cannot be read. An upstream MAJOR bumps us a MINOR, not a patch: semver describes our 81-tool contract, not our dependency versions. Caveat: `@actual-app/api` majors are CalVer and roll over every January regardless of content, so this fires annually by construction. Rollback runbook: `docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

**The rest of the train chain.** Each script solves a distinct "the train died and nobody noticed" failure, and note that they are split across TWO workflows: the two reporting/verification controls deliberately live in `ci-cd.yml`, which runs on every push, because a control that only runs inside the scheduled train cannot report that the scheduled train never ran.

| Script | Ticket | Runs in | What it catches |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `scripts/stdio-framing-check.mjs` | #323 | `dependency-update.yml` | **Blocking gate.** Asserts every byte the server writes to stdout under `--stdio` parses as newline-delimited JSON-RPC. Note WHY it is byte-level rather than a functional suite: `src/logger.ts` already hijacks `console.*`, so an upstream `console.log` is a non-issue (26.7.0 already had 14 of them and stdio survives). The genuinely uncovered mode is a raw `process.stdout.write` from the dependency, which the hijack does NOT intercept and which nothing in `src/` patches. It also fits the train's step budget, where a full dual-transport run would not |
| `scripts/report-train-failure.mjs` | #325 | `dependency-update.yml` (job `report-train-failure`) | A failed run used to produce only a red entry in the Actions tab. Opens or updates one GitHub issue, and closes it when a later run succeeds. Fed by the CLOSED `train_outcome` enum |
| `scripts/verify-published-artifacts.mjs` | #326 | `ci-cd.yml` (job `Verify Published Artifacts`) | A green pipeline proves the publish JOBS exited 0, not that a third-party registry now serves the artifact. Separates "the run triggered", "the run went green", and "the artifact exists" |
| `scripts/report-train-stale.mjs` | #327 | `ci-cd.yml` (job `Train Liveness`) | A train that never RAN, which #325 cannot see. GitHub disables scheduled workflows in public repos after 60 days of inactivity, and cron dispatches are dropped under load. Runs with `issues: write` and deliberately does NO `npm ci`, so it never executes a third-party install script while holding that permission |

#322 closed the CI-to-train gate parity gap without introducing a reusable workflow. Each script has a unit test in the `test:unit-js` chain (`stdio_framing_check`, `verify_published_artifacts`, `report_train_failure`, `report_train_stale`, `train_preflight`).

**Refusals are decided by TYPE, not by matching message prose (#377).** When a tool needs to turn "you asked for something that cannot happen" into a structured response, it asks `isPreflightRefusal(error)` from `src/lib/errors.ts`, never `msg.includes('not found')`. The adapter guards throw `NotFoundRefusal` / `OutOfRangeRefusal`, both `PreflightRefusal`, meaning the operation was not attempted and nothing was written. The full three-rule taxonomy (already-holds is a SUCCESS, does-not-exist THROWS, `{success:false}` only for a genuine multi-outcome contract) plus the known deviations live in `.claude/skills/api-design-principles/SKILL.md`, which is the home both `tool-author` and `ticket-gate` read. One deliberate exception: `src/lib/rejection-allowlist.ts` cannot import anything from the project (its purity invariant is enforced by `rejection-allowlist-purity.test.js`), so it reads the refusal BRAND through `Symbol.for` and keeps prose matching only as a fallback for errors this server does not raise itself.

**An optional FILTER id that is actually a NAME is refused with the id it resolves to (#388).** Every Category B field (twelve optional `accountId` / `categoryId` / `payeeId` filters) routes through `adapter.resolveFilterId`, so the surface has ONE answer to the most likely caller mistake. It used to have three: `transactions_search_by_amount` resolved the name and named the correct id, `transactions_get` refused with a bare not-found, and the other nine silently returned an EMPTY RESULT SET, which is the worst of the three because it reads as "no transactions match" and a model believes it. That inconsistency, rather than the loose schema that surfaced it, was the defect.

Three things about it are deliberate and should not be tidied away. **The schemas stay bare strings**, because tightening them to `CommonSchemas` ids would reject before the handler runs and so DELETE the resolution, trading the best message on the surface for a ZodError; the `tool_id_schema_drift` exceptions therefore stay, with reasons that now name the resolver instead of a pending decision. **A well-formed id reads no listing at all**, so a correct call costs exactly what it did. **`verifyExists` is asymmetric**: the five tools that already read the listing unconditionally keep their existence check for a well-formed id that names nothing, and the rest are not made to pay a listing on every call to catch a mistyped UUID, a mistake nobody makes. `bank_sync` is the one exception that opts in without having paid before, because its id reaches a THIRD PARTY and spends a rate-limited quota. `transactions_uncategorized` is the twelfth and was not in the ticket's list of eleven: review found it holding `CommonSchemas.accountId`, so a name there got "Invalid uuid" and no id, which is the answer this change exists to replace. It is an optional filter, so it moved to Category B rather than staying with the required lookup ids #380 tightened. `tests/unit/filter_id_tool_wiring.test.js` calls each field with a name and requires a typed refusal, because a source grep would pass on a call whose result is discarded.

**Amounts are always in integer cents**: `5000 = $50.00`, `-5000 = -$50.00`. Never use decimal dollars.

**`MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` must be the raw token only**, not `"Bearer token123"`. The server extracts the token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and compares directly.

**`MCP_ENABLE_HTTPS=true`** enables native TLS. Set `MCP_HTTPS_CERT` and `MCP_HTTPS_KEY` to PEM file paths. A reverse proxy is still preferred for production (certificate rotation, SNI), but native TLS works for simple single-host deployments.

**Date fields require `YYYY-MM-DD` strings**. Never use `Date.now()` (it produces a number).

**Multi-budget mode**: `BUDGET_N_NAME`, `BUDGET_N_SYNC_ID`, `BUDGET_N_SERVER_URL`, `BUDGET_N_PASSWORD`, `BUDGET_N_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` (N = 1, 2, 3…). Server URL and password fall back to the default `ACTUAL_*` vars if omitted.

**`mcp-remote` requires `--allow-http`** for HTTP connections, because it enforces HTTPS by default. Without the flag, clients see `URL must use HTTPS`. Some versions of Claude Desktop also enforce HTTPS at the app level; in that case, switch to native TLS (`MCP_ENABLE_HTTPS=true`).

**Documentation hygiene**: Prefer deletion over archiving. When a feature ships, delete its `docs/feature/*.md` spec. Planned and future work is tracked as GitHub issues, not a roadmap file. Never move to `archive/` folders; git history is the archive.

**Version/tool count markers** (`**Version:**`, `**Tool Count:**`) across all docs are managed automatically by `scripts/version-bump.js` on `release:*` / `docs:sync`. Never edit them manually.

**Production-tag freshness check (added in v0.6.5):** before any bump, `scripts/version-bump.js` queries `git ls-remote --tags origin` and aborts if the local `VERSION` is BEHIND the latest published `vX.Y.Z` tag. This guards against the parallel-bump pattern that occurred when the scheduled `Dependency Update & Auto-Release` workflow shipped a release while a local branch was unsynced. If you see the abort message, run `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` before retrying. Override only with `--force`, and only when production is genuinely wrong; the `release-manager` agent requires explicit user confirmation before invoking that flag.

**`npm overrides` are a last resort for security CVEs only.** Prefer upgrading the direct dependency that pulls in the vulnerable transitive. If an override is unavoidable (no direct-dep upgrade available), add it with an explanation in `package.json`'s `"comments"."security-overrides"` field, in this shape:

```jsonc
"overrides": { "qs": "6.14.0" },
"comments": {
  "security-overrides": {
    "qs": "GHSA-xxxx: array-limit bypass. No direct-dep upgrade available; <parent> still pins 6.11. Remove when <parent> ships a fix."
  }
}
```

Never use overrides to resolve non-security version drift. **There are currently NO overrides and no `comments` key in `package.json`, and that is the healthy state**, so the shape is written out above rather than pointed at. This paragraph used to say "see existing `ajv`/`qs` entries as the pattern" and those entries did not exist (#401): the overrides were removed when the direct dependencies were upgraded, which is what this policy prefers, and the citation outlived them. An example embedded in the doc cannot drift out from under the doc; a citation to a live instance can, and this one did, in the one paragraph that is only ever read by someone under pressure to ship a CVE fix.

**Settling an abandoned budget load is part of ACQUIRING the api lock (#393), not something call sites remember.** Every round of #390 guarded per call site and every round missed one: round 1 missed the legacy path (a silent cross-tenant read), round 2 put the wait in two adapter entry points and missed the three `loadBudgetTracked` sites that reach the api without passing through them, so a session opening during the window untracked the abandoned load and the leak stayed reachable. `withApiLock` now performs the wait itself, which makes the set of call sites stop mattering: nothing reaches `@actual-app/api` without the lock, so nothing reaches it without the wait. **The wait is BOUNDED and FAILS CLOSED.** An unbounded one was a P0 worse than the leak it closed: both call sites sat inside the mutex and outside any timeout, so a single never-settling download blocked every session forever with no error and no recovery short of a restart, which is precisely the mode `opTimeout.ts` exists to remove and #270 already removed. On timeout it throws and KEEPS the registration, because proceeding would run against a singleton a landing download may re-point underneath it, and clearing would forget the landing. The accepted consequence: a genuinely stuck upstream load degrades the process until restart, with a legible error per request. Registrations are a SET whose entries remove themselves on settle, because a single slot let one load overwrite another's registration and a chained promise could never be cleared by its creator.

**Budgets are loaded through ONE function, and an abandoned load is waited for (#390).** `withOpTimeout` races; it does not cancel. A `downloadBudget` that exceeds `ACTUAL_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` KEEPS RUNNING and later re-points the singleton outside the mutex, and upstream's `api/download-budget` begins with `close-budget` before `load-budget`, so an abandoned download closes whatever is loaded and opens something else mid-flight. Two leaks were reproduced from this: a record written only on success left the singleton describable as the OLD budget while it moved to the new one, and even a correctly-recorded outcome landed BETWEEN a session's check and its raw call. A mutex cannot serialise a promise its holder abandoned. So every load goes through `loadBudgetTracked` in `src/lib/budgetLoader.ts`, which clears the record BEFORE starting (an abandonment can then only leave it indeterminate, the safe direction), registers the promise, and records the true outcome whenever it settles.

**A resolved `downloadBudget` is not proof a budget is open, so `loadBudgetTracked` also checks (#396).** Upstream's `api/download-budget` DISCARDS the `{ error }` that `load-budget` returns, in both of its branches, and `load-budget` does not throw: it returns an error object having already called `closeBudget()` internally. The sync that follows cannot catch it either, because `_fullSync` begins `if (... || !currentId) return []`, so with nothing loaded it reports success by returning nothing. The result is that `downloadBudget()` RESOLVES, no budget is open, and every later call throws `No budget file is open` permanently for that data dir. It is still unfixed upstream, so a dependency bump does not help. The post-condition probe is `api.getBudgetMonths()`, and it sits INSIDE the tracked chain rather than after the awaited `withOpTimeout`, so an ABANDONED load is verified when it lands instead of recording a success nobody checked; the two-call network diagnosis deliberately sits outside that chain, where a caller is actually waiting, because every `withApiLock` acquisition settles all registrations under one bound. Three things about this file are load bearing and easy to undo by accident: the chain is `.then(onFulfilled).catch(onRejected)` because a throw from `onFulfilled` is NOT caught by the sibling `onRejected` of the same `.then`; nothing in it may call anything that takes `withApiLock` (#402 tracks making that structural), which is what lets `actualConnection.ts` acquire the lock itself and call in; and the diagnostic's `setLoadedBudgetSyncId(null)` must stay in the same brace-balanced block as its `api.loadBudget(` call, because that is the window block (4) of `tests/unit/budget_selection_precondition.test.js` inspects. Since #396 there are SIX load sites, not five: `src/actualConnection.ts` was the sixth and is production reachable via `USE_CONNECTION_POOL=false`, which routes `connectToActualForSession` to `connectToActual()` on every HTTP session open. `awaitAbandonedBudgetLoad()` is then called at BOTH entry points to the api, the precondition and `initActualApiForOperation`, so a late landing happens before the next check rather than during the next operation. Covering only the precondition is not enough and the test proves why: a failed session-open poisons the singleton, `_hasPooledConnection` then reports false because it also checks `isApiInitialized`, and the next operation reaches the legacy path without passing the precondition at all.

**A session operates on ITS OWN budget, and that is a checked precondition (#390).** `@actual-app/api` is process-global with ONE loaded budget, while the pool tracks up to `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` entries that each carry their own `syncId`. Nothing used to record which budget was actually loaded, and both re-entry paths skip the download for good reasons of their own: `ActualConnectionPool.getConnection` returns early for an initialised entry, and `initActualApiForOperation` returns early when the singleton is live (#134's fix for the #127 auth burst). Together they meant a session operated on whatever budget was loaded last, by anyone. Reproduced through the real tool path: session A opened on budget A and wrote to it, session B opened and switched to budget B, and session A's NEXT write landed in budget B, which in a multi-user deployment is another person's finances. **The budget ACL could not see this**: `_enforceBudgetAcl` validates the budget the session BELIEVES it is on, while the operation executes against whatever is loaded, so a session authorised for budget A only could have its write land in budget B and the check would still pass. `apiState.ts` now records the loaded `syncId`, and `ensureLoadedBudgetMatchesSession()` verifies it INSIDE the api lock before every pooled read, pooled write and write drain. Inside the lock is essential: outside it another session can change the budget between the check and the operation. Two things to keep true when editing: every `downloadBudget` call site must record what it loaded (`tests/unit/budget_selection_precondition.test.js` fails and names any that does not, and it caught two on the first pass), and a single-budget deployment must stay free, which it is because the syncIds always match and nothing is downloaded.

**Two more singleton rules, from the #394 and #392 batch.** First, EVERY budget load now goes through `trackBudgetMutation` in `src/lib/budgetLoader.ts`, not just downloads: `importBudget` re-points the singleton exactly as a download does, and upstream's import is expected to run for minutes, so its timeout is the normal case rather than a rare one. Before this, the `imported:` sentinel was written AFTER the await, so a timeout skipped it and the record went on naming the PRE-IMPORT budget while the singleton moved to an out-of-registry, un-ACL'd file. The accepted cost of registering it is written in that function's doc comment and is not free: a long import stalls other sessions for one `ACTUAL_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` each (#407 tracks giving imports their own bound). Second, `api.shutdown()` now takes the api mutex: `ActualConnectionPool.shutdownConnection` acquires it and `shutdownConnectionLocked` is the variant for the five adapter call sites that already hold it, with the audit of which is which recorded on that method. Two consequences that are easy to undo by accident: the wrapper must SWALLOW a failed acquisition, because since #393 acquiring the lock can itself reject and the idle sweep calls it from `setInterval` unawaited, where the escape reached `unhandledRejection` and called `process.exit(1)`; and the sweep must re-check expiry INSIDE the lock (`onlyIfExpired`), because the wait is no longer negligible and a session touched while the eviction queued would otherwise be closed mid-conversation.

**The abandoned-load wait is per OPERATION, not per lock acquisition (#406).** #393 made settling an abandoned load part of ACQUIRING the api lock, which makes the set of call sites stop mattering: nothing reaches the api without the lock. That holds wherever one acquisition serves one operation. The write drain is the exception, because it acquires ONCE and then runs N operations inside, so before #406 every operation after the first ran without ever waiting, against a singleton an abandoned load was about to re-point. `processWriteQueue` now calls `awaitAbandonedBudgetLoad` at the top of each operation's body, BEFORE `ensureLoadedBudgetMatchesSession` and deliberately not inside it: that function returns early when the loaded budget already matches, and an operation whose budget matches still needs the wait, because the abandoned load is about to move the singleton away from it. A rejection there is caught by the loop's own per-op catch, so a stuck load fails ONE operation rather than the batch. The cost is that the bound is re-paid per remaining operation, which is #414.

**A budget IMPORT has its own timeout (#407), and the reason generalises.** `ACTUAL_IMPORT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 600000) exists because an import is legitimately long rather than stalled, and since #394 it is a TRACKED load that every other session waits on, so abandoning it at the ordinary 30s operation bound turned one tenant's import into a process-wide stall without making the import any faster. Two places carry it, and missing either makes the other dead letter: `trackBudgetMutation` passes it to `withOpTimeout`, and `queueWriteOperation` carries a `timeoutMs` on the queue entry because the drain's own per-op `withOpTimeout` would otherwise abandon the import first. A long operation needs no keep-alive: `cleanupIdleConnections` passes `onlyIfExpired`, so the sweep re-checks expiry AFTER acquiring the mutex (#392), and the drain touches every session in the batch before releasing it. A heartbeat was written for this and removed in review once that was traced.

**The #390 call-site guard now asserts REGISTRATION, not a setter.** Block (4) of `tests/unit/budget_selection_precondition.test.js` used to require a `setLoadedBudgetSyncId(` inside the matched call's brace-balanced block. Once every load funnelled through `trackBudgetMutation` that stopped discriminating, because the raw sites carried a redundant clear that existed only to satisfy the scan while deleting the helper's REAL record kept it green. It now accepts a raw load that is an ARGUMENT to a tracker at any enclosing level (walking back through unclosed parens, so `withConcurrency(retry(...))` nesting is fine), and otherwise requires `registerBudgetLoad(`. Two earlier rewrites of this guard were caught being weaker than what they replaced: a file-wide exemption for `budgetLoader.ts` blinded it in the file most likely to gain a new load path, and proximity matching hid any rogue load within 12 lines of a tracker call. One shared `unguardedLoadSites()` serves both the scan and its own teeth cases, because a self-check that reimplements the predicate drifts from it and then reports green while the real one is neutered.

**Session tools are the only exception to `withActualApi`**: `actual_session_list` and `actual_session_close` call `connectionPool` directly. They manage the pool itself, not budget data, so they skip the wrapper intentionally.

**If transactions/budgets don't persist**: verify `withActualApi` wraps the call (grep for `rawAdd*` / `rawUpdate*` called without it), confirm `api.shutdown()` runs after the operation (or that `api.sync()` ran in pool mode), and check logs for "tombstone" errors. The `getConcurrencyState()` export from `actual-adapter.ts` shows `{ running, queueLength, maxConcurrency, authRetries, authRetryFailures, connectionReuses }` for diagnosing concurrency back-pressure and pool-reuse health. A growing `connectionReuses` counter without growing `authRetries` is the healthy signal that #134's cooperation is working.

**Integration test runner kill-switches (added in v0.6.4 via #133):** `tests/manual/index.js` (used by `/local-env` and `npm run test:integration:*`) now caps every retry path so a crash-looping MCP server can't livelock the runner. Defaults can be overridden via env vars when you need to relax them in a slow environment or tighten them in CI:

| Env var | Default | What it caps |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `MCP_TEST_MAX_RETRIES` | 5 | Connection-lost / timeout retries per `callMCP` invocation |
| `MCP_TEST_MAX_SESSION_RETRIES` | 3 | Session-expired re-initialisations per logical chain (closure-state, survives recursion) |
| `MCP_TEST_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD` | 10 | Consecutive failed `callMCP` invocations before the circuit breaker opens |
| `MCP_TEST_MAX_RUNTIME_MS` | per-level (sanity 60s, smoke 120s, normal 300s, extended 600s, full 900s) | Wall-clock budget in `runner.js`; exceeding it exits **code 2** (distinct from code 1 used for assertion failures) with `Aborted after N min, server appears unhealthy` |
| `MCP_TEST_TRANSPORT` | `http` | Which transport the suite runs over: `http` or `stdio` (#280) |
| `MCP_TEST_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` | unset | Designates a budget as DISPOSABLE. The pre-run residue sweep deletes nothing unless this matches the budget the server has loaded. Unset = sweep skipped (#280) |
| `MCP_TEST_SWEEP_MAX` | 50 | Abort the sweep rather than delete more than this many objects (wrong-budget signal) (#280) |

## Documentation Map

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: component layers, data flow, transport protocols
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`: canonical inventory of every config variable (type, default, source, read site). A var is canonical if it is a Zod schema key in `src/config.ts` OR an entry in `RAW_ENV_ALLOWLIST` in `src/lib/config-registry.ts`. The drift guard `scripts/config-drift.mjs` (run in CI via `tests/unit/config_drift.test.js`) fails the build when the schema/allowlist, `.env.example`, and the README env table disagree. Run `npm run config-drift` after touching any config var.
- `docs/NEW_TOOL_CHECKLIST.md`: canonical 9-step guide for adding tools
- `docs/TESTING_AND_RELIABILITY.md`: test-file inventory, integration test module table
- `docs/guides/AI_CLIENT_SETUP.md`: LibreChat/LobeChat setup, Docker networking, TLS, OIDC/ACL
- `docs/guides/MCP_CLIENTS_SETUP.md`: per-client setup recipes (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.); complements AI_CLIENT_SETUP.md
- `docs/audit/api-coverage-baseline.json`: accepted uncovered `@actual-app/api` methods (#321). Human-maintained by deliberate commit; the drift lane never writes it. Suppresses REDNESS only, never re-filing (that is the tracker sentinel's job). Guarded by `tests/unit/api_coverage_baseline.test.js`
- `docs/audit/write-effect-audit.md`: which write tools can report success for an upstream call that did nothing, with the evidence and the `@actual-app/api` version it was taken against (#350/#362). Also documents the extraction method that makes a re-audit cheap: `@actual-app/api` ships its full upstream TypeScript source in `dist/index.js.map` (`sourcesContent`), so the audit runs offline against the exact installed build. Staleness is reported by `scripts/check-write-effect-audit.mjs` in the NON-BLOCKING `api-surface-drift` lane, never in `test:unit-js`: see #321 for why that placement is load bearing.
- `docs/audit/dep-audit-cache.json`: cache used by `/dep-auditor` to skip recently-checked libraries; do not edit manually
- `docs/audit/deadcode-audit-cache.json`: cache used by `/code-health-auditor` (#234) to avoid re-filing dead-code findings (keyed `kind:path:symbol`); the skill maintains it. The committed `knip.json` is the dead-code config (blocking in CI since #237: `knip` exits nonzero on dead code); `tests/unit/knip_config.test.js` guards its entry points and that `scripts.knip` stays failing-mode (no `--no-exit-code`), and `tests/unit/advertised_tools_sync.test.js` guards that README-advertised tool names exist in `IMPLEMENTED_TOOLS`.
- `docs/audit/FORK_ANALYSIS.md`: fork-feature analysis maintained by the `fork-analysis` skill (one row per analysed fork branch, both a cache so unchanged branches are skipped next run and a source of implementation ideas). Lives alongside the other skill-maintained audit artifacts; `scripts/tool-count.mjs` scans it for tool-count drift.
- `docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT.md`: Docker Compose profiles, Kubernetes, upgrade steps
- `scripts/README.md`: what every script in `scripts/` is for. Most are reachable through an npm script, but a few are direct-invoke diagnostics with no npm wrapper: `stdio-smoke.mjs` (drives the stdio transport end to end via `docker exec` inside the already-healthy bearer container, so no secrets touch the host; override the container with `MCP_STDIO_CONTAINER`), `regression-270-stall.mjs` and `diag-270-http.mjs` (the #270 operation-timeout stall), `import-test-budget.sh`, and `bootstrap-and-init.sh`
- `docs/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md`: auth models, threat model
- `tests/manual-prompt/`: three prompt files for LLM-driven end-to-end verification (paste sequentially into an AI chat); update when adding tools
- `docker/description/long.md`, `docker/description/short.md`: Docker Hub descriptions; managed by `npm run docs:sync`
- `.env.example`: all environment variables with inline documentation
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`: four PATH-SCOPED convention files (Copilot format, but the rules are the project's own). Each has an `applyTo` glob: `src/tools/*.ts` (tool naming, file name must match the tool name, `CommonSchemas` usage, parse-before-logic, and the reminder that `verify-tools` reads `dist/` so you must build first), `tests/unit/*.{js,ts}`, `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`, `tests/manual/tests/*.js`. Worth reading before editing a file under that glob, but **THIS file wins on conflict**, and each of those files now says so explicitly. `tool-files.instructions.md` used to carry a blanket "never import `@actual-app/api` directly", which was never true: `budget_updates_batch.ts` had imported it since January 2026, two months before that file was written, and the four `withWriteSession` tools joined later under #142. It has been corrected to the five-file rule above. Its companion rule, "do NOT add a second wrapper", was always right and is now stated with the deadlock as its reason. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is the repo-wide sibling and overlaps heavily with this file, so it drifts the same way
- `unraid/actual-mcp-server.xml` + `docs/UNRAID_CA_PUBLISHING.md`: the Unraid Community Applications template and its publishing guide. `tests/unit/unraid_template_alignment.test.js` pins the template's port against `MCP_BRIDGE_PORT` in `src/config.ts`, its `Data` mount against `ENV MCP_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR` in the `Dockerfile`, the `<Repository>` literal, `Mask="true"` on the three secret fields, `Required="true"` on `MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION`, and that the `<Description>` still warns a blank token disables HTTP auth (six positive checks plus a negative one); `.github/workflows/unraid-xmllint.yml` validates the XML. Note what is NOT guarded: the template's env-var SET is not diffed against `src/config.ts` or `RAW_ENV_ALLOWLIST`, so adding or renaming an env var will pass CI while leaving the template stale. Mirror it by hand
