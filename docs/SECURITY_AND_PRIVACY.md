## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Methods

#### 1. **Bearer Token Authentication**

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and recommended

**Both methods on the MCP path are gated (#447).** POST and GET (the SSE stream)
now run the same `authenticateRequest` check. Before #447 only POST called it in
the default static-bearer posture, so a GET on the identical path was
unauthenticated. The practical exposure was small, because that route returned
constants and a stream keyed by a 122-bit server-generated session id, but the
inconsistency blocked reporting a session's init failure there (#438) and is the
kind of gap that becomes a hole the moment a more informative response is added.
**This is a behaviour change**: an SSE client that connected without a token
previously received a 400 and now receives a 401.

**How it works**:
```yaml
# LibreChat configuration
mcpServers:
  actual-mcp:
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer your_secure_token_here"
```

**Token Generation**:
```bash
# Generate secure random token
openssl rand -hex 32

# Or use Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**Environment Configuration**:
```bash
MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION=your_generated_token
```

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ Stateless - no session management needed
- ✅ Works with HTTP transport
- ✅ Can be rotated without restarting server

#### 2. **OIDC / JWT Authentication**

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (`AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`)

**How it works**: The server validates JWTs using JWKS from the OIDC issuer.
No PKCE flow runs on the server. The MCP client (e.g., LibreChat) handles the OAuth code exchange.

**JWKS discovery and transport security (#244)**: the JWKS URI is resolved from the issuer's
OpenID discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`), not a hardcoded path, so standard
IdPs work. The issuer must be https (a plaintext issuer lets a network attacker swap the JWKS and
forge tokens); a loopback issuer is allowed for local dev, and `OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE_ISSUER=true`
is an explicit opt-out for a trusted-network http issuer (for example a LAN Casdoor). The resolved
`jwks_uri` must be https and same-origin with the issuer, the discovery fetch does not follow
redirects, and a failed or expired token now returns a clean 401 (the jose error is wrapped, never
the token, so no token material leaks).

**Audience allowlist (#245)**: the `aud` claim is validated against a strict, closed set: the
required `OIDC_RESOURCE` plus any explicitly configured `OIDC_ACCEPTED_AUDIENCES` (comma-separated,
for IdPs like Authentik that put the client-id in `aud`). The membership check stays inside jose,
empties are filtered, and there is no wildcard or accept-any path, so a token whose `aud` is outside
the configured set is still rejected (the cross-relying-party replay protection from #160 holds).
With no extras configured the set is exactly `[OIDC_RESOURCE]`, unchanged from before.

**Cross-origin JWKS allowlist (#254)**: by default the resolved `jwks_uri` must be same-origin
with the issuer. `OIDC_JWKS_TRUSTED_HOSTS` (comma-separated `host` or `host:port`, exact match,
lowercased, no wildcards) is an opt-in relaxation of ONLY that same-origin check, for IdPs that
legitimately serve keys from another host (Google: issuer `accounts.google.com`, JWKS on
`www.googleapis.com`). An allowlisted cross-origin `jwks_uri` must be https with NO exemption:
neither `OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE_ISSUER` (the #244 opt-out covers a same-origin LAN issuer only)
nor a loopback host relaxes the cross-origin path, so the allowlist can never produce a
plaintext third-party key fetch. Also still enforced: no embedded credentials, no discovery
redirects, the discovery timeout, and the audience allowlist. Matching is port-strict
(`URL.host`), a bare-host entry does not trust odd ports on that host, entries are validated by
a canonical URL round-trip at startup (a `:443` suffix, raw-unicode IDN, or unbracketed IPv6
throws instead of sitting inert), and every allowlist acceptance is logged with issuer origin
and JWKS host for an audit trail. Empty (default) means the same-origin-only behaviour is
byte-identical to before.

**OAuth discovery metadata endpoints (#285)**: in OIDC mode the server publishes two unauthenticated
discovery documents so OAuth clients (mcp-remote, Claude.ai) can bootstrap a login. `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
(RFC 9728) identifies this resource server, and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414) is the
authorization server metadata, re-served from the IdP's own OpenID discovery document because several clients
resolve that path against the resource-server origin and some IdPs (Authentik) do not expose it there. Security
posture: the document is fetched ONCE at startup (the same hardened fetch used for JWKS discovery: https-only issuer,
no redirects, timeout), so no client request ever triggers an outbound fetch and there is no request-path SSRF
surface. It is served verbatim and exposes only the endpoints the IdP already publishes publicly (no tokens,
secrets, or internal hosts), and it is intentionally unauthenticated because a client must read it before it holds
a token. If the startup fetch fails, the server does not start in OIDC mode (fail closed), so the route is never
registered with a partial document, and it is absent entirely when `AUTH_PROVIDER` is not `oidc`.

**Configuration**:
```bash
AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso.yourdomain.com
OIDC_RESOURCE=your-client-id          # must match 'aud' claim in JWT
OIDC_SCOPES=                          # leave empty for Casdoor (no scope claim)
AUTH_BUDGET_ACL={"alice@example.com":["budget-sync-id-1"]}
```

**Casdoor compatibility**: Casdoor auth-code flow JWTs omit the `scope` claim.
Set `OIDC_SCOPES=` (empty string) so the server enforces no scope requirements and logs `Scopes required: (none)`.

**Per-user Budget ACL** (`AUTH_BUDGET_ACL`):
```
# Format: a JSON object mapping each principal to an array of budget sync IDs.
# Use "*" as the sync ID to grant wildcard (all-budget) access.
AUTH_BUDGET_ACL={"alice@example.com":["aaa-bbb-ccc"],"group:admin":["*"]}
```
Principals are matched against the JWT `sub` claim, the `email` claim, and each entry of the `groups` (or `roles`) claim, where group entries match as `group:<name>`.
If `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL` is not set, all authenticated users access the single configured budget.

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ JWKS-validated JWT (cryptographically verified)
- ✅ Per-user budget isolation via `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL`
- ✅ Compatible with Casdoor v2.13, Keycloak, Auth0
- ✅ Group-based access control
- ⚠️ Requires OIDC issuer reachable from MCP server

#### 3. **Password-Based (Actual Budget)**

**Purpose**: Authenticate with Actual Budget server

**Configuration**:
```bash
ACTUAL_PASSWORD=your_actual_budget_password
```

**Security**:
- ✅ Stored in environment variables
- ✅ Never logged or exposed
- ✅ Supports Docker secrets
- ❌ Cannot use OAuth/JWT (Actual Budget limitation)

### Authorization Model

**Default** (`AUTH_PROVIDER=none`): Single-user, full access

**OIDC mode** (`AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`): Per-user budget ACL via `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL`

**All authenticated users can**:
- Read all financial data
- Modify all transactions
- Delete accounts and budgets
- Access all tools

**With `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL` configured**:
- Each user is mapped to a specific budget sync ID
- Users can only access their own budget
- Group principals (`group:admins`) give shared access
- Suitable for household or small-team deployments

**Without `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL`**:
- All authenticated users share the single configured budget
- Suitable for personal use

#### Identity matching for the dynamic ACL, and what it inherits (#343)

When `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_SOURCE=actual`, the principal is matched against Actual's
`userName`, resolved with Actual's own claim precedence: `preferred_username`,
`login`, `email`, `id`, `sub`.

**This is not the identifier OIDC would recommend, and the reason is worth stating.**
OIDC Core guarantees only that `sub` is "locally unique and never reassigned";
`preferred_username` carries no such guarantee and is editable by the user at many
IdPs. v0.11.0 keyed on `sub` for exactly that reason and the feature did not work at
all: Actual stores no `sub`. It resolves the precedence above, saves the result as
`user_name`, and generates an unrelated UUID as `userId`. There is no field a `sub`
can be compared against, so every principal resolved to zero budgets.

**The exposure is inherited, not introduced.** An IdP that lets a user set
`preferred_username` (or an unverified `email`) to another user's value allows
impersonation HERE exactly as it does in Actual's own login, because Actual keys its
accounts the same way. This server does not widen the surface; it matches it.

**Mitigation for operators who need better.** Pin `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_CLAIM` to a claim
your IdP does not let users edit, and ensure that same claim is what populates
Actual's `user_name`. Note this must be true on BOTH sides: pinning a claim here that
Actual did not use produces no matches and denies everyone.

**Stronger mitigation: bind the principal explicitly (#345).**
`AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_IDENTITY_MAP` takes `<sub>=<actual userName>` pairs and is consulted
before the precedence:

```bash
AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_IDENTITY_MAP=a1b2c3d4e5f6opaque=jdoe,f7e8d9c0b1a2opaque=asmith
```

This removes the mutable-claim exposure entirely for the principals it covers, because
the lookup key is the verified `sub` and nothing a user can edit at the IdP changes it.
It also answers two failure modes no claim heuristic can:

- **A claim absent from the access token.** Actual derives `user_name` from the
  UserInfo RESPONSE, while this server reads the verified ACCESS TOKEN. An IdP that
  returns `preferred_username` from one and not the other denies every principal.
- **An IdP-side rename.** Actual writes `user_name` once at first login and never
  updates it, so renaming a user at the IdP breaks the join permanently.

**The map is authoritative.** If a `sub` is bound and its target matches no budget
file, the principal is DENIED; there is no fallback to the claim precedence. That is
deliberate: a fallback would let an operator typo be masked by an accidental claim
match, granting access through a path nobody configured while the mistake stays
invisible. A blank target is rejected at startup, because it would match the
service-account row that owns every file.

**Finding the values to bind.** With `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_SOURCE=actual`, the server logs
one `dynamic ACL preflight` line at startup naming every `userName` on offer. If that
line reports none, the Actual server is almost certainly in password mode, where
`userName` is blank for every row and no principal can ever resolve.

#### Reading identity from the UserInfo endpoint (#346)

`AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_IDENTITY_SOURCE=userinfo` resolves the principal by calling the
IdP's UserInfo endpoint with the caller's own access token, then applying Actual's
precedence to that RESPONSE. It is the same document Actual read
(`client.userinfo(tokenSet.access_token)` in `openid.ts`), so it removes the entire
class of mismatch where an IdP returns a claim from UserInfo but omits it from the
access token.

**It is opt-in, and the default remains `token`, because it is a real trade.**
Enabling it makes the IdP a hard dependency of authorization: while UserInfo is
unreachable, every principal is denied. It also requires the access token to have been
issued with the `openid` scope, which this server does not require (`OIDC_SCOPES` is
optional), so a client that never requested it gets a 401 from UserInfo and is denied.

**Controls on that request:**

- **Same origin only.** The `userinfo_endpoint` must share an origin with
  `OIDC_ISSUER`. Unlike `jwks_uri` there is deliberately no allowlist: this request
  carries a bearer token rather than fetching public keys, so a wrongly-trusted host
  is a token exfiltration primitive. An operator who allowlisted a key host under
  #254 never agreed to have access tokens posted there.
- **Subject binding (OIDC Core 5.3.2).** The `sub` in the response must equal the
  `sub` in the verified access token. Without this check, anything able to answer as
  that endpoint could return another user's `preferred_username` and be handed that
  user's budgets. A mismatch is denied outright and is never retried against the
  token claims, so a detected substitution cannot become a silent downgrade.
- **Bounded and fail closed.** The request is bounded by
  `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_USERINFO_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5s, no disable value). A timeout, a
  transport error, a non-JSON body, a signed `application/jwt` body (refused rather
  than trusted unverified), a 401/403, or a response with no usable claim all deny.
  None of them fall back to the token claims: a fallback would change which identity
  resolves at the moment the system is least healthy.
- **Untrusted values are not coerced.** A `preferred_username` that is an object, or
  an `email` that is a number, is treated as absent rather than stringified into an
  identity.
- **The response body is never logged.** It is user PII by definition.
- **Caching.** Successful resolutions are cached for 60 seconds keyed on `sub`, so a
  principal costs at most one UserInfo request per minute. Failures are not cached.
  This does not widen the revocation window beyond the ACL cache that already exists.

`AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_IDENTITY_MAP` is consulted BEFORE this and short-circuits it, so an
explicit binding costs no network call and keeps working while the IdP is down.

**Guards that hold regardless of the claim chosen:**
- A missing, non-string or blank claim yields a null principal, never `''`.
- The matcher skips blank `userName` values. This matters because the MCP server's own
  password/service account appears in every file's access list with `owner: true` and a
  blank `userName`; without the guard, a principal resolving to empty would inherit
  owner access to every budget on the server.
- Every failure path denies. An unreachable server, an unparseable response, or an
  unmatched principal all return no budgets, never a wildcard.

#### Known limitation: the dynamic ACL resolves via a budget download (#338)

When `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL_SOURCE=actual`, the ACL is resolved with `adapter.getBudgets()`.
Every adapter session init calls `downloadBudget(ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID)`, so resolving
the ACL also downloads the configured DEFAULT budget, even though the ACL only needs
the file list.

This is not a correctness problem: a working, downloadable default budget is already
required for the server to serve any tool at all, so it introduces no failure mode that
did not already exist. It is an efficiency cost, bounded by the resolver's 60 second
per-principal cache, so it is one download per principal per minute at worst.

The clean fix is a narrow adapter entry point that lists budget files without
downloading one. It was deliberately not built, because it means touching
`src/lib/actual-adapter.ts` (the modify-with-caution tier, and the owner of the
non-reentrant session lock) for a performance gain rather than a correctness one.

#### Known limitation: `actual_budgets_import` creates an un-ACL'd budget (#334)

`actual_budgets_import` wraps `@actual-app/api`'s `importBudget()`, which does not
merely read a file. Verified against `importActual` in the installed package and
against a live server: it closes the current budget, restores the archive **under the
budget id the archive itself carries**, and loads it. Three consequences follow, all
accepted behaviour rather than defects:

1. **It can OVERWRITE an existing budget.** Because the id comes from the archive
   rather than being freshly generated, re-importing an export of budget X restores
   onto budget X and replaces that budget's local data. This is exactly what makes
   export and import a usable backup-and-restore pair, and it is also why an import
   against a budget holding real data is destructive. It is only "a new budget" when
   the archive's id is not already present on the server.
2. **A budget the import creates is outside the ACL.** `AUTH_BUDGET_ACL` maps
   principals to budget sync IDs that exist when the ACL is evaluated, so a budget
   that first appears mid-session has no ACL entry covering it. The ACL is still
   enforced on the way IN (the write queue uses the same enforcement choke point as
   every other write, so a caller cannot import while denied the budget they started
   from), but it cannot constrain a budget that did not exist when the decision was
   made.
3. **The `path` input reads the server's filesystem.** The tool accepts a path so an
   operator can restore an `actual_budgets_export` output. That path is not
   restricted to the export directory, so any file the runtime user can read may be
   handed to the importer. The importer rejects anything that is not a valid budget
   archive, so this is a validity oracle rather than a file-disclosure primitive: it
   does not return file contents.

**Operational guidance.** In a shared or multi-user HTTP deployment, treat
`actual_budgets_import` as an administrative operation. If your threat model does not
allow it, remove it from the advertised surface rather than relying on the ACL to
contain it. In single-user stdio deployments (Claude Desktop), the caller already has
the user's own filesystem privileges and this adds no new capability.

`actual_budgets_export` carries none of this: it is read-only, writes only inside
`ACTUAL_EXPORT_DIR`, and its filename input is restricted to a flat alphanumeric
charset so it cannot traverse out of that directory.

## 🔒 Production Branch Protection (#267)

Two repository rulesets protect `main` server-side (configured 2026-07-05; they live in repo
settings, so this section is the versioned record of their intended shape):

1. **`main: append-only (no force pushes, no deletion)`**: blocks force pushes and branch
   deletion for EVERYONE, no bypass actors. Even an allowlisted or stolen credential cannot
   rewrite or erase history; main is append-only.
2. **`main: restrict pushes to release paths`**: the `update` rule restricts direct pushes to
   exactly two bypass principals: the repository admin role (the maintainer's `/release`
   fast-forward) and the `actual-mcp-dependency-updater` GitHub App, App ID 2603676 (the
   auto-release lane in `dependency-update.yml`, which pushes main and release tags with an
   App-token-authenticated checkout since #261).

Rationale and the full options analysis live in issue #267. Client-side guards (the
release-gate hook and the version-bump freshness abort) remain as defense in depth, but the
rulesets make the develop-first policy hold for every machine and credential, and they also
prevent Dependabot security-update PRs (which always target the default branch) from being
merged outside the release path. If these rulesets are changed, update this section; drift
between this record and `gh api repos/agigante80/actual-mcp-server/rulesets` output is a
red flag.

## 🛡️ Data Protection

### Data at Rest

#### Budget Data Cache

**Location**: `MCP_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR` (default: `./actual-data`)

**Contents**: SQLite database with all budget data

**Protection**:
- ✅ Local filesystem permissions (0600 recommended)
- ✅ Not exposed via API
- ✅ Can be encrypted at filesystem level (LUKS, FileVault)
- ❌ No application-level encryption (relies on OS)

**Recommendation**:
```bash
# Set restrictive permissions
chmod 700 ./actual-data
chown $USER:$USER ./actual-data

# Or use encrypted volume
# Linux: LUKS
# macOS: FileVault
# Windows: BitLocker
```

#### Budget Preference Store

**Location**: `MCP_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR/budget-preferences.json`

**Contents**: a map from `sha256(principal)` to a budget sync id. It lets a re-initialized session (after a server restart) restore the user's last active budget.

**Protection**:
- ✅ Keys are SHA-256 hashes of the principal: the raw OIDC subject, email, or bearer token is never written to disk
- ✅ Written with `0600` permissions, atomically (temp file + rename)
- ✅ Never trusted as authorization: the live access list is re-checked before a stored budget is applied, so a stale entry cannot widen access
- ✅ Safe to delete at any time (the feature simply falls back to the default budget)
- Authentication itself is validated per request from the live token; nothing in this file grants access

#### Log Files

**Location**: `MCP_BRIDGE_LOG_DIR` (default: `./logs`)

**Risk**: May contain sensitive data in error messages

**Protection**:
- ✅ File permissions (0600)
- ✅ Log rotation with retention limits
- ⚠️ Sanitization needed (ongoing improvement)

**Best Practices**:
```bash
# Restrict log file permissions
chmod 600 ./logs/*.log

# Regular cleanup
find ./logs -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Data in Transit

#### Encryption password over the upstream (#161)

When an E2E budget encryption password is set (`ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASSWORD`, or a
`BUDGET_N_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`), the server refuses to start if the matching
upstream `ACTUAL_SERVER_URL` (or `BUDGET_N_SERVER_URL`) is `http://`, because the
password would be sent in cleartext (CWE-319). Use `https://` for the upstream,
or set `ALLOW_INSECURE_UPSTREAM=true` only when the hop is genuinely trusted
(e.g. an isolated Docker network).

#### HTTPS/TLS

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

**Configuration**:
```bash
MCP_ENABLE_HTTPS=true
MCP_HTTPS_CERT=/app/certs/cert.pem
MCP_HTTPS_KEY=/app/certs/key.pem
```

**Certificate Options**:
1. **Self-signed** (development)
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes \
     -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 \
     -subj "/CN=your-server-ip"
   ```

2. **Let's Encrypt** (production)
   ```bash
   certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
   ```

3. **CA-signed certificate** (enterprise)

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ Encrypts all traffic between client and server
- ✅ Protects Bearer tokens in transit
- ✅ Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- ✅ Required for production deployments

#### Connection to Actual Budget

**Protocol**: HTTP or HTTPS (configurable)

**Security**:
- ⚠️ Often unencrypted (local deployment)
- ✅ Password transmitted securely via `@actual-app/api`
- ✅ Can use HTTPS if Actual Budget server supports it

**Recommendation**: Deploy Actual Budget and MCP server on same network/host

#### Network exposure and bind host (#239)

The HTTP server defaults to binding `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). The `/health` and
`/metrics` endpoints are intentionally UNAUTHENTICATED (they are liveness and Prometheus
scrape targets), so on an exposed interface anyone who can reach the port can read them.

**Recommendation**: limit the listening interface with `MCP_BRIDGE_BIND_HOST`. Set it to
`127.0.0.1` to restrict the server (including `/health` and `/metrics`) to loopback, or to a
specific private address to keep it off untrusted networks. As of #239 this value is honored:
it is passed to `app.listen()`, so the server binds only to the configured interface. Leave it
at `0.0.0.0` only when remote clients must reach the MCP endpoint directly, and pair that with
authentication (`MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` or OIDC) and ideally a reverse proxy.

#### HTTP auth is required by default (#242)

A blank `MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` with `AUTH_PROVIDER` unset used to disable all HTTP
authentication silently, and the server binds `0.0.0.0` by default, so a forgotten token
published the server open on the LAN. As of #242 the server fails closed instead: in HTTP mode,
if the bind host is non-loopback (anything other than `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`,
`::ffff:127.0.0.1`, so the `0.0.0.0` default counts) AND neither `MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` nor
`AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc` is configured, the server logs a clear error and exits non-zero before
binding. The decision is made once at startup against the configured bind host (not per request
on `req.ip`, which a reverse proxy and a spoofed `X-Forwarded-For` could otherwise bypass).

Unaffected: loopback binds (local dev), stdio mode, and any deployment with a token or OIDC
configured. The per-request Bearer/OIDC checks are unchanged.

**Opt-out**: set `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` (the exact string `true`) to run open
deliberately, for example behind your own authenticating proxy. The server then starts with a
loud warning on every boot.

**Upgrade note (behavior change)**: an existing HTTP deployment on a non-loopback bind with no
token and no OIDC that previously started open will now refuse to start. The startup error names
the fix: set `MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`), or
`AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`, or `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` to keep the old open behavior.

## 🔒 Secure Coding Practices

### Secrets Management

#### ✅ DO

**Use environment variables**:
```typescript
const password = process.env.ACTUAL_PASSWORD;
```

**Validate with Zod**:
```typescript
const configSchema = z.object({
  ACTUAL_PASSWORD: z.string().min(1)
});
```

#### ❌ DON'T

**Hardcode secrets**:
```typescript
// NEVER DO THIS
const password = "my-secret-password";
```

**Log secrets**:
```typescript
// NEVER DO THIS
logger.info(`Password: ${password}`);
```

**Commit secrets**:
```bash
# NEVER DO THIS
git add .env
git commit -m "Added config"
```

### Input Validation

#### All User Inputs Must Be Validated

**Using Zod schemas**:
```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  accountId: z.string().uuid(),
  amount: z.number().int(),
  date: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/)
});

// Validation happens automatically in tools
```

**SQL Injection Prevention**:
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (Actual Budget API handles this)
- ❌ Never concatenate user input into SQL

**Path Traversal Prevention**:
- ✅ Validate file paths
- ✅ Use `path.resolve()` and check prefix
- ❌ Never directly use user input in file operations

### Error Handling

#### ✅ DO

**Provide helpful but not revealing errors**:
```typescript
throw new Error('Account not found');  // Good
```

**Log detailed errors securely**:
```typescript
logger.error('Account access failed', { 
  accountId, 
  userId,
  // Don't log passwords or tokens
});
```

#### ❌ DON'T

**Leak system information**:
```typescript
// NEVER DO THIS
throw new Error(`Database connection failed: ${dbConnectionString}`);
```

**Expose stack traces to users**:
```typescript
// NEVER DO THIS
return { error: error.stack };
```

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

#### 1. **Dependency Auditing**

**Command**:
```bash
npm audit
```

**CI/CD Integration**: Runs on every push

**Policy**:
- **Critical**: Block merge, fix immediately
- **High**: Block merge, fix before next release
- **Moderate**: Track, fix in next patch
- **Low**: Track, fix opportunistically

#### 2. **TypeScript Type Checking**

**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Purpose**: Catch type errors that could lead to security issues

**CI/CD Integration**: Runs on every push

#### 3. **Secret Scanning**

**Manual check**:
```bash
git grep -i "password\|token\|secret\|api.?key" -- "*.ts" "*.js" "*.json" | grep -v "PASSWORD"
```

**Recommended**: Add `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`

### Manual Security Reviews

**Before major releases**:
1. Review authentication logic
2. Check for exposed secrets
3. Verify input validation
4. Test error handling
5. Review Docker security

**Checklist**: See [Security Review Checklist](#security-review-checklist)

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Vulnerability Reporting

**If you discover a security vulnerability:**

## 🔄 Dependency Security Management

### Vulnerability Monitoring

**Automated Scanning:**
- **Tool:** GitHub Dependabot + Renovate Bot
- **Frequency:** Weekly (Mondays at 9 AM UTC)
- **Scope:** All npm dependencies (production + dev)
- **Alert Threshold:** Moderate severity and above

**Manual Audits:**
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages with vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically (use with caution)
npm audit fix
```

**The automated `@actual-app/api` update lane is independent of dependency security state (#298, maintainer decision):** the unattended release train (`.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`) deliberately does NOT gate the API upgrade on `npm audit`. A pre-existing or unrelated CVE elsewhere in the tree must never hold back an `@actual-app/api` update. Dependency vulnerabilities are handled out of band by Dependabot and `/dep-auditor`, not by this release train. Human-driven CI (`ci-cd.yml`) still runs an advisory `npm audit --audit-level=high` (log-only, `|| echo`) and Trivy scans the built image, so vulnerability visibility is preserved without coupling it to the API update.

### Vulnerability Response SLA

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Action |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | 24 hours | Immediate patch, emergency deploy |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | 48 hours | Priority patch, next scheduled deploy |
| **Moderate** | 4.0-6.9 | 1 week | Scheduled patch, next sprint |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | 1 month | Routine maintenance update |

### CVE Tracking

**Process:**
1. **Detection:** Dependabot/Renovate alerts on new CVE
2. **Assessment:** Review CVE details, CVSS score, exploitability
3. **Impact Analysis:** Determine if vulnerability affects our usage
4. **Remediation:** Apply patch or workaround
5. **Verification:** Test fix, deploy, monitor
6. **Documentation:** Automated via dependency update workflow

**Recent CVE Resolutions:**
- See CI/CD audit results and GitHub Dependabot alerts for current vulnerability status.
- Run `npm audit` locally at any time for an up-to-date report.

### Dependency Update Policy

**Patch Updates (x.x.X):**
- **Frequency:** Weekly automatic updates
- **Auto-merge:** Yes, after CI passes
- **Review:** Post-merge monitoring
- **Risk:** LOW - bug fixes and security patches only

**Minor Updates (x.X.x):**
- **Frequency:** Bi-weekly
- **Auto-merge:** Dev dependencies only
- **Review:** Required for production dependencies
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - new features, possible deprecations

**Major Updates (X.x.x):**
- **Frequency:** Quarterly or as needed
- **Auto-merge:** Never
- **Review:** Required + breaking change analysis
- **Risk:** HIGH - API changes, behavior changes, migration required

### Dependency Audit Reports

**Automated Audits:**
- Weekly dependency audits (automated via GitHub Actions)
- Continuous security vulnerability scanning (Dependabot)
- Automated dependency updates and PRs
- See `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml` for automation details
- Breaking change assessments
- Update recommendations and roadmap

**Update Frequency:** Monthly (automated generation via CI/CD)

**Last Audit:** See CI/CD pipeline for current status (automatically audited on every push).
- Run `npm audit` locally to get an up-to-date report at any time.

### Dependency Pinning Strategy

**Production Dependencies:**
- Use caret ranges (`^1.2.3`) for automatic patch updates
- Pin specific versions for problematic packages
- Lock file (`package-lock.json`) committed to git

**Git Dependencies:**
- None currently. All dependencies are pinned npm packages resolved through `package-lock.json`.
- If a git dependency is ever added, pin it to a specific commit SHA rather than a branch name.

**Version Overrides:**
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "vulnerable-package": "1.2.3"  // Force specific version tree-wide
  }
}
```

### Supply Chain Security

**Measures:**
1. ✅ Lock file committed (`package-lock.json`)
2. ✅ Automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Renovate)
3. ✅ CI/CD validation (npm audit in pipeline)
4. ⚠️ Package signatures: Not verified (npm limitation)
5. ⚠️ Subresource Integrity: Not applicable (server-side)

**Best Practices:**
- Review dependency changes in PRs
- Verify package maintainer reputation (npm downloads, GitHub stars)
- Avoid dependencies with excessive transitive deps
- Monitor for typosquatting attempts
- Use npm audit before every release

**Dependency Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Package has > 1M weekly downloads OR established reputation
- [ ] Last update within 6 months (actively maintained)
- [ ] Permissive license (MIT, Apache, ISC, BSD)
- [ ] No open critical security issues
- [ ] Reasonable dependency tree (< 50 transitive deps)
- [ ] TypeScript types available (@types/* or built-in)

## 🔧 Docker Security

### Container Security

**Non-root user**:
```dockerfile
USER app
```

**Minimal attack surface**:
- Alpine base image
- Multi-stage build
- Only production dependencies

**Best practices**:
```bash
# Run with read-only filesystem
docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp

# Limit resources
docker run --memory=512m --cpus=1

# Drop capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL
```

### Secrets Management

**Docker secrets (Swarm/Compose)**:
```yaml
secrets:
  actual_password:
    file: ./secrets/password.txt

services:
  mcp:
    environment:
      ACTUAL_PASSWORD: ${ACTUAL_PASSWORD}
```

**Environment variables**:
```bash
# Recommended: pass via .env file or shell environment
docker run -e ACTUAL_PASSWORD=$(cat secrets/password.txt)
```
