# Testing & Reliability

**Project:** Actual MCP Server  
**Version:** 0.21.0  
**Purpose:** Define testing philosophy, frameworks, and enforcement policies  
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-07

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test Before Commit**: No code is committed without passing tests
2. **Test Pyramid**: Unit tests (most) → Integration tests → E2E tests (least)
3. **Fail Fast**: Tests catch issues early in development
4. **Continuous Testing**: CI/CD runs full test suite on every push
5. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests reflect actual usage patterns

### Testing Goals

- **Prevent Regressions**: Catch breaking changes before they reach production
- **Document Behavior**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Enable Refactoring**: High coverage enables confident code changes
- **Ensure Reliability**: Production code works as expected

```

### Test Types

| Command | Type | Speed | Scope | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `npm run test:adapter` | Smoke | ⚡ 30s | Adapter layer | Pre-commit |
| `npm run test:unit-js` | Unit | ⚡ 5s | Single unit | Development |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Protocol | ⚡ 10s | MCP protocol | Pre-commit |
| `npm run test:e2e:docker` | Integration | 🐢 60s | Full stack | Pre-merge |
| `npm run test:all` | All | 🐢 90s | Everything | Before release |

### Pre-Commit Tests (Essential)

```bash
# Essential tests before commit
npm run build                    # TypeScript compilation & type checking
npm run test:adapter             # Adapter smoke tests (30s)
npm run test:unit-js             # Unit + schema tests (3s)
npm audit --audit-level=moderate # Security check
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Complete test suite
npm run test:all             # Runs: adapter + unit + Docker E2E (smoke)

# Or run individually:
npm run build                # Build TypeScript
npm run test:adapter         # Adapter tests
npm run test:unit-js         # Unit tests: schema, smoke, negative-path
npm run test:e2e             # Protocol tests (fast, no Docker)
npm run test:e2e:docker      # Docker integration smoke (thorough)
npm audit                    # Security audit
```

### Docker E2E Tests

**Full stack integration testing with real Actual Budget server:**

```bash
# Run Docker-based E2E tests (quick smoke tests)
npm run test:e2e:docker

# Run comprehensive ALL TOOLS test (50+ tests)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts

# Advanced options
./tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh --no-cleanup   # Leave containers for debugging
./tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh --verbose      # Detailed output
./tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh --build-only   # Just build, don't test
```

**What Docker E2E tests verify:**
- ✅ Docker build works correctly
- ✅ Container networking (MCP ↔ Actual Budget)
- ✅ Real tool execution (**all 81 tools at 100% coverage**)
- ✅ Session management and persistence
- ✅ Production-like deployment
- ✅ Error handling and validation (15+ error scenarios)
- ✅ Regression tests (strict validation, batch operations)

**Test Suites:**
- **docker.e2e.spec.ts**: Basic smoke tests (11 tests)
- **docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts**: Comprehensive all-tools test (81 tools, 80+ test cases)

### Multi-user ACL E2E (`scripts/acl-e2e.sh`)

Not part of `test:e2e:docker`. It stands up its own stack (an Actual server in
multi-user OpenID mode plus `navikt/mock-oauth2-server`) because the budget ACL is
the one behaviour whose correctness depends on an identifier produced by ANOTHER
system.

```bash
bash scripts/acl-e2e.sh          # build the environment + fixture, then verify
bash scripts/acl-e2e.sh --keep   # leave the containers up for debugging
node scripts/acl-e2e-verify.mjs  # re-run the scenarios against a kept environment
```

**Why it cannot be a Playwright suite.** It needs a password bootstrap FIRST and
OpenID enabled second (`@actual-app/api` authenticates with a password, and an
OpenID-only server rejects it), an IdP that is up before Actual reads discovery at
startup, and an IdP reconfiguration after the users exist. Compose cannot express
that ordering.

**The property it exists to protect (#344).** Alice and bob are created by driving
a REAL authorization-code login, so Actual runs its own precedence over the UserInfo
response and stores the result. The harness then READS BACK the `user_name` Actual
derived and writes it to `.release/acl-e2e-fixture.json` as `actualUserNames`; every
assertion uses that value. It never asserts what the name should be. The login
supplies `preferred_username` and `email` as deliberately different strings, so the
stored value also reveals which claim the precedence chose.

This matters because the harness previously created users with `POST /admin/users`
passing `userName: "alice"` and then configured the IdP to mint
`preferred_username: "alice"`: both sides of a cross-system join chosen twelve lines
apart in one file, which is internally consistent by construction and cannot fail
for the reason that matters. That shape hid #343 for two releases.

**What it covers for #346.** The mock IdP serves a genuine `/userinfo`, and it is the
same endpoint Actual itself calls to derive `user_name`, so the UserInfo identity
source is exercised end to end against a live IdP: a real token, a real discovery
document, a real response. That block deliberately passes NO token claims, so an
implementation that quietly read the access token instead would resolve to null and
fail. What it does NOT cover is the divergence case (a claim present in UserInfo but
absent from the access token), because mock-oauth2-server derives the UserInfo body
from the token's own claims and the two cannot disagree. That case needs the shim
described in #346, so this proves the mechanism rather than the motivating bug.

**Proving it is still not vacuous.** After a green run, rename the user inside
Actual so its `user_name` no longer matches the token identity, and re-run the
verifier. It must go red (3 assertions, verified 2026-08-10). The exact commands are
in the header of `scripts/acl-e2e.sh`. `tests/unit/acl_e2e_fixture_contract.test.js`
guards the same properties statically in CI, since a vacuous harness passes and so
running it proves nothing on its own.

## 🔬 Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Test individual functions in isolation

**Location**: `tests/unit/*.js`

**Files**:
| File | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `transactions_create.test.js` | Zod schema: valid input accepted, empty input rejected |
| `generated_tools.smoke.test.js` | All 81 tools: stub adapter, call succeeds, response shape correct |
| `schema_validation.test.js` | Negative-path schemas: `rules_create`, `budget_updates_batch`, `budgets_transfer`, `budgets_setAmount` |
| `schema_json_openai_compat.test.js` | Every published tool schema is OpenAI/ECMA-262 regex-compatible: no `\p{...}` escape, each `pattern` compiles without the `u` flag (#293) |

**Run**:
```bash
npm run test:unit-js   # runs the full unit chain (~52 files) sequentially
```

**Coverage**: 81/81 tools smoke-validated (offline, stub adapter). 60+ negative-path assertions across 11+ tool schemas.

### 2. Adapter Tests

**Purpose**: Verify Actual API integration

**Location**: `src/tests_adapter_runner.ts`

**What they test**:
- `withActualApi` wrapper lifecycle (init/shutdown)
- Retry logic: 3 attempts, exponential backoff, recovery from transient failures
- Concurrency queue: 5-session limit, overflow queuing
- Adapter-infrastructure assertions only, no tool business logic

**Run**:
```bash
npm run test:adapter
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests

**Purpose**: Test full user workflows

**Location**: `tests/e2e/` (Playwright)

**Framework**: Playwright ^1.60.0

**Scenarios**:
- MCP client connects to server
- LibreChat loads all 81 tools
- User performs complete workflow via chat

**Run**:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Status**: Fully operational. `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` covers all 81 tools end-to-end.

### 4. Connection Tests

**Purpose**: Verify Actual Budget connection

**Command**:
```bash
npm run dev -- --test-actual-connection
```

**What it tests**:
- Can connect to Actual Budget server
- Can authenticate with password
- Can download budget data
- Budget data is valid

**Use case**: Quickly verify environment configuration

### 5. Tool Tests (deprecated path; use unit tests instead)

**Purpose**: Smoke test all 81 tools

**Command**:
```bash
npm run test:unit-js
```

**What it tests**:
- All tools are registered
- All tools have valid schemas
- All tools can be called without errors (with stub data)

**Use case**: Verify tool coverage after changes

### Hermetic unit suite and chain membership (#321)

Two rules protect every other guard in `tests/unit/`.

**1. No unit test may enumerate the live `@actual-app/api` surface.** A test whose result changes with no commit is not a unit test. `check_coverage.test.js` used to derive its method list from `await import('@actual-app/api')` and assert the genuine-gaps bucket was empty; 26.8.0 added three methods, the test went red, the auto-release train died for two consecutive nights, and security PR #319 was blocked behind the same failure because regenerating its lockfile floated the dependency to 26.8.0.

It now classifies against `FROZEN_API_SURFACE`, a hand-captured fixture that is never regenerated from `node_modules`. The one genuinely external claim, "are there uncovered methods on the live surface", moved out of the unit suite into the `api-surface-drift` lane, where a gap is REPORTED rather than blocking.

The rule is scoped to enumeration. Importing the package to monkeypatch it for mocking is correct and is what 20 unit tests do; an earlier draft of the rule banned the import outright and would have condemned all of them.

**2. Every `tests/unit/*.test.js` must appear in the `test:unit-js` chain.** That chain is a hand-maintained `node A && node B && ...` list with no glob, so an unlisted file never runs in CI or in the mandatory pre-commit sequence while still reading as coverage. `server_info.test.js` and `transfers_create.test.js` were already orphaned this way; both passed and were simply added. `tests/unit/unit_chain_membership.test.js` enforces membership, carries an allowlist that requires a non-empty reason per entry, and ships with that allowlist empty.

---

### Gate parity between CI and the release train (#322)

The release train could **tag what CI would reject.** ci-cd's Lint job ran `knip`, and the repo runs `node-version-drift`, and neither ran in the train, so a dependency bump introducing dead code or an inconsistent Node pin would publish while an ordinary PR carrying the same change was blocked.

**Deliberately not solved by extracting a reusable workflow.** `on: workflow_call` is a job-level construct: it runs on its own runner with its own checkout. The train gates a commit that exists only in the runner's local git (the working branch is pushed to origin *after* the gate) against a `node_modules` mutated in-job. A reusable workflow would gate the **pre-upgrade tree** and report green, which is the same defect class #322 was filed to fix.

The gate's CONTENT is already single-sourced, in `package.json` scripts. What was missing was PRESENCE. So the fix is two steps in the train plus an invariant, not a new abstraction:

| Check | ci-cd | Train | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build` | yes | yes | runs twice in the train (own step plus the #297 re-verify) |
| `test:unit-js` | yes | yes | likewise |
| `knip` | yes | yes | added by #322 |
| `node-version-drift` | yes | yes | added by #322 |
| `actionlint` | yes | **no** | excluded permanently, see below |
| `check:coverage` | yes | **no** | excluded permanently by #321 |

**`actionlint` is excluded on purpose, and permanently (#328).** The reason first recorded here ("pin the installer, then add it") was wrong: #328 pinned the installer and the exclusion still stands. The real reason is **reachability**. The train's only file mutations are `sed -i` on `README.md` and `npm run version:bump`, which writes `README.md`, `docs/*.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Nothing under `.github/workflows/` changes, so actionlint's entire input surface is outside the train's mutation set. #322's rationale was "the train could tag what CI would reject", which is a reachability test rather than a completeness checklist: `knip`, `build` and `test:unit-js` earn their place because the dependency bump changes what they inspect, and actionlint does not. It is also already covered on the published tree, since `ci-cd.yml` triggers on tags with no ref filter on its lint job and the train watches that run with `gh run watch --exit-status`.

**`check:coverage` is excluded permanently.** It enumerates the live `@actual-app/api` surface, which is exactly what killed the train (#321).

Invariant `(q1)` asserts set equality against `PARITY_CHECKS` so the two lanes cannot drift apart again, `(q2)` and `(q3)` pin the two exclusions along with their reasons, and the counter-fixture removes each check globally rather than once, because two of them run twice and a single-shot fixture would have proved nothing.

---

### The stdio framing gate (#323)

The release train runs `test:e2e:docker:full` against a live Actual Budget server, so **HTTP already has real integration coverage with real write paths**. stdio, the transport Claude Desktop users run, had none.

**The risk is narrower than it first appears.** The ticket was written around "a new `@actual-app/api` version that adds a `console.log` would silently break every Claude Desktop user". That is not true: `src/logger.ts` already replaces `console.log/info/warn/error/debug`, and `@actual-app/api` already calls `console.log` at 14 sites today while stdio works fine.

The genuinely uncovered failure mode is a direct **`process.stdout.write`**, which the console hijack does not intercept and which is patched nowhere in `src/`. A raw byte on fd 1 corrupts JSON-RPC framing for every stdio client.

**Tiered, deliberately.**

| Tier | What | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `scripts/stdio-framing-check.mjs`: boots the server over stdio and asserts every stdout byte parses as newline-delimited JSON-RPC | **Yes**, in the train |
| 2 | The full dual-transport run (`scripts/deploy-and-test.sh`) | No. Remains the local main-promotion gate |

Tier 1 is under a minute and deterministic. The full run is 30 to 35 minutes against a job whose step caps already consume most of its budget, so making it blocking would need a cap near 130 and would materially raise the chance of a **job-level cancel**, the unattributable state #325 exists to prevent. It would also put the flakiest suite in the repo on the critical path of an unattended publisher.

It does **not** use the SDK's `StdioClientTransport`. That transport consumes stdout to parse frames, so it structurally cannot report a raw byte that never formed a frame, and that byte is the entire subject of the check.

**Two CI mechanics that are easy to get wrong, both encoded as tests:**

1. **The sync id does not cross the `docker exec` boundary.** `docker-compose.test.yaml` does not carry `ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` in its `environment:` block. The service entrypoint reads `/tmp/actual-sync-id.txt` and `export`s it, so it lives in PID 1's runtime environment, and `docker exec` builds a new process's environment from container **config**, not from PID 1. It arrives empty. The framing check reads the same file the entrypoint reads.
2. **The stdio data dir must be writable and must be neither `/tmp` nor `/app/data`.** `/tmp` is mounted `bootstrap-data:/tmp:ro`, so a `mkdir` there fails, and it fails inside a bare `catch {}` that resurfaces later as an ENOENT during adapter init. `/app/data` is the HTTP server's own directory, and #280 established that two `@actual-app/api` instances must never share one budget cache.

---

### Train liveness: detecting a train that never RAN (#327)

`report-train-failure.mjs` reports a train that **failed**. It cannot report one that **never ran**, because no run means no reporter job, which lands in the same found-by-eye state #325 was filed to fix.

Two verified causes:

- **GitHub disables scheduled workflows in PUBLIC repositories after 60 days of repository inactivity.** This repo is public, so it applies. Near-daily commits keep resetting the clock, so this is the lower-probability cause today.
- **Cron dispatches are delayed under load and dropped under sufficiently high load.** GitHub does not guarantee a scheduled run fires. This is the live cause, and it is why the train's cron moved off minute 0, the top-of-hour peak GitHub advises scheduling away from.

**Two signals, because they detect disjoint failures.** The workflow `state` field (`active`, `disabled_manually`, `disabled_inactivity`) is directly observable, immediate and threshold-free, and catches a disabled workflow. Recency of the newest `event=schedule` run catches a workflow that is `active` but not firing anyway. Recency alone was the original proposal and is the worse primary: it is a derived proxy that cannot fire until the threshold has elapsed.

Four query details are load bearing:

- **`event=schedule` is filtered.** `dependency-update.yml` also carries `workflow_dispatch`, and manually dispatching the train is the *first* diagnostic step when it looks dead. An unfiltered query would let that diagnostic reset the liveness clock while the cron stayed dead. Status is deliberately **not** filtered: a scheduled run that failed still proves the cron fired, and reporting that failure is #325's job.
- **`created_at`, not `run_started_at`.** `created_at` timestamps the dispatch, which is the property under test. `run_started_at` conflates dispatch with runner availability and would report a queued-but-dispatched run as a dead cron.
- **An affirmative windowed probe runs FIRST, and can only ever say ALIVE (#443).** Before reading the page, the check asks the API directly whether any `event=schedule` run exists with `created>=<now minus threshold>`. Verified against the live endpoint before it was written: the qualifier IS honoured, but a MALFORMED value returns zero rather than erroring. So a non-empty result is proof of life and is independent of both ordering and which window the API returned, while an empty result proves nothing and falls back to the page read. The worst a broken cutoff can do is degrade to the previous behaviour. On a healthy train it also SHORTENS the run, since the page read is skipped.
- **A PAGE is read and the newest run is selected by timestamp, never by position (#436).** The check used to read `per_page=1` and take `workflow_runs[0]`, which assumes newest-first ordering. That ordering is undocumented and cannot be requested: the endpoint accepts `actor`, `branch`, `check_suite_id`, `created`, `event`, `head_sha` and `status`, and has no `sort` or `direction` parameter. On 2026-09-04 a read placed a 292h-old run at the head while a 4.5h-old run existed, which failed the job, opened a false P2 (#434) and blocked releases until the job was re-run. It now reads `per_page=30` and selects `max(created_at)` via `selectNewestScheduledRun`. Because a read can also be incomplete rather than merely misordered, and no page size fixes an EMPTY page, a workflow the first pass calls stale gets exactly one confirming re-read after `CONFIRM_DELAY_MS`, and is reported only if both reads agree. That delay is paid only when the check is about to call a workflow dead, never on the healthy steady state. A read that FAILED yields an `inconclusive` finding, which suppresses the close branch: an unknown is not evidence of recovery, and closing on one would delete a valid alert and defeat the dedupe.

**Why this is a separate reporter rather than a `stale` member of `TRAIN_OUTCOME`.** Trace `classifyOutcome`'s gate order. Passing `stale` *without* adding it to `KNOWN_OUTCOMES` files a mislabelled "the release train failed" issue pointing at the wrong run. *Adding* it to `KNOWN_OUTCOMES` passes the unknown-value gate, fails the rest, and falls through to `{action:'ignore'}`: exit 0, green, nothing filed. That is the exact defect this ticket exists to eliminate, reproduced inside its own fix.

This is the **inverse** of the `noop_soaking` lesson, where omission from the set caused a false P1 nightly. There the fix was to add the member; here adding it is the silent branch. Two mitigations pulling in opposite directions is why the classifier is separate rather than a judgement call.

**Its own label, for the same reason.** Sharing #325's `train-failure` marker would mean this reporter's healthy path hits `decideTransition`'s `close_all` and closes every open train-failure issue with a comment falsely asserting recovery. Because `ci-cd.yml` runs on every push to `develop`, a genuine unresolved failure would be auto-closed within minutes of the next routine push. The liveness reporter uses `train-stale`, and its healthy steady state performs **zero** tracker writes.

**Accepted limitation:** the check lives in `ci-cd.yml` and so is itself conditional on pushes to `develop`. A genuinely dormant repository silences both it and the cron. That is the same 60-day dormancy that disables the schedule in the first place, so it is recorded as accepted rather than papered over.

---

### The API surface drift lane (#321)

The live `@actual-app/api` surface moves without a commit. That signal used to live inside a unit test, which is why an upstream release could turn the suite red with nobody touching the repo. The signal is real; it is not a unit test. It lives in `.github/workflows/api-surface-drift.yml`, on `schedule` plus `workflow_dispatch` only.

**Non-blocking is structural, not conventional.** Nothing in `ci-cd.yml` or `dependency-update.yml` declares `needs:` on either job, and there is no `pull_request` trigger, so a red run cannot gate a merge or the release train. Invariant (d6) enforces it.

| Job | Permissions | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `detect` | `contents: read` | `npm ci`, reads the live surface, classifies against the baseline, emits JSON as a job output. Holds no tracker-write token. |
| `report` | `issues: write`, `contents: read` | Consumes that JSON and files or dedupes issues. Runs no `npm ci` and never imports `@actual-app/api`. |

The split is mandatory for the same reason as #325's, with more force: reading the surface means `await import('@actual-app/api')`, which **executes upstream top-level module code in-process**. That must never share a process with a tracker-write token.

**Four conditions, not one:**

| # | Condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | New uncovered method, not in `accepted` | Red, files one issue |
| 2 | Stale baseline entry: now covered, or no longer exported | Red, no filing |
| 3 | **Removed covered method**: `API_TO_TOOL` maps a method the surface no longer exports | Red, files a P1 |
| 4 | `accepted` larger than `maxAccepted` | Red, no filing |

Condition 3 is the dangerous direction and the one the original design missed. Additions are benign (a feature we lack); a removal means a shipped MCP tool calls a method that does not exist, failing at runtime in a user's budget. `mappingErrors` does not catch it: that only checks the mapped TOOL exists in `IMPLEMENTED_TOOLS`, never that the mapped METHOD still exists upstream.

**Redness and re-filing are separate mechanisms.** `docs/audit/api-coverage-baseline.json` is a committed file, so CI cannot write it; a baseline entry therefore suppresses REDNESS only. Re-filing is suppressed by a tracker query on the `api-coverage-gap` label for a `<!-- api-gap:METHOD -->` body sentinel, with `state=all` rather than `state=open`, because a maintainer closing a gap as wontfix has made a permanent decision. That query paginates to exhaustion; a single page would silently stop suppressing once 100 such issues exist.

Auto-committing the baseline from CI is rejected: an auto-written entry would carry an empty reason and no owning issue, letting the machine grant its own acceptance, and it would need `contents: write` on a job that must stay low-privilege.

Gap names come from `Object.keys()` over a third-party module namespace, so they are validated against a strict identifier pattern before reaching an issue title or body, and per-run filing volume is capped at 5 with the overflow reported.

### Release-train failure notification (#325)

The `@actual-app/api` auto-release train publishes unattended, so **the notification is its only human interface.** It was silently dead for two consecutive nights before anyone noticed by eye, which is what this contract exists to prevent.

**Governing principle: when in doubt, notify.** Every control fails toward reporting, never toward silence. A control that fails quiet reproduces the original defect. Two drafts of the design got this backwards (a strict semver check that refused to file, and a `!cancelled()` guard blind to job timeouts) before review caught it.

`dependency-update.yml` publishes a closed `TRAIN_OUTCOME` enum as a job output; the separate `report-train-failure` job switches on it:

| `TRAIN_OUTCOME` | Reporter action |
|---|---|
| `success` | Close any open failure issue |
| `noop_up_to_date` | Nothing. Not a success, not a failure |
| `noop_denied`, `noop_not_forward` | Nothing. Working as intended (both added by #324, whose pre-flight work owns the denylist and the `sort -V` direction check) |
| `failure` | Open or update the failure issue |
| unset or unrecognised | Treated as `failure` |

Four properties are load bearing:

1. **The enum is corroborated, not trusted.** It is single-sourced and written mid-job, so if it reports any non-`failure` value while a step concluded `failure`, the observed conclusion wins and the disagreement is stated in the issue.
2. **The reporter is a separate job.** The main job runs `npm install @actual-app/api@^$LATEST`, executing registry postinstall code, and holds the App installation token that `actions/checkout` persists into `.git/config`. Granting it `issues: write` would put a tracker-write token in that process. The reporter instead holds only `issues: write` plus `actions: read` and checks out with `persist-credentials: false` and `ref: github.sha`.
3. **No log scraping, ever.** The failing step name comes from the Actions jobs API, which makes "no credential material in the issue body" structural rather than conventional. `::add-mask::` redacts logs, not an API payload.
4. **Errors are asymmetric.** A reporting error on a real failure leaves the run red. A reporting error on a healthy run degrades to a warning annotation, so a tracker blip cannot manufacture a phantom train failure.

Dedupe is on the `train-failure` marker label rather than the version, because `@actual-app/api` has shipped same-day double bumps; a version-scoped issue would be orphaned when the train fails on one and recovers on the next. Recurrences update a counter block in the issue body in place, so an unattended nightly stays readable on night thirty.

There is deliberately **no `concurrency:` group** on the reporter: `cancel-in-progress: false` still evicts a queued run, so a success/failure/success overlap would drop the failure report. Converging duplicate issues onto the oldest is noisy but never silent.

## 🛡️ Security Testing

### Dependency Auditing

**Command**:
```bash
npm audit
```

**Severity Levels**:
- **Critical**: Must fix immediately
- **High**: Fix before next release
- **Moderate**: Fix in next patch release
- **Low**: Track but not blocking

**Policy**:
- **Pre-Commit**: No moderate/high/critical vulnerabilities
- **CI/CD**: Fails on high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Regular**: Run `npm audit fix` monthly

### Code Health & Dead-Code Detection (#234)

Dead/unused code (unused files, exports, types, orphaned modules) is detected by **Knip**
via the committed `knip.json`:

```bash
npm run knip            # blocking since #237: exits nonzero on any dead code
```

- **CI/CD**: the `Check for dead code` step in the `Lint Code` job runs `npm run knip` in
  failing mode (#237): it exits nonzero on any unused file/export/type and FAILS the job, so
  new dead code cannot merge. `tests/unit/knip_config.test.js` guards that `scripts.knip`
  stays failing-mode (no `--no-exit-code`).
- **Guard tests** (in `test:unit-js`, fail CI on drift): `tests/unit/knip_config.test.js`
  (every `knip.json` entry root exists on disk) and `tests/unit/advertised_tools_sync.test.js`
  (every `actual_<domain>_<action>` tool name advertised in `README.md` resolves to
  `IMPLEMENTED_TOOLS`, catching documented-but-missing/renamed tools). These join the existing
  doc-to-code drift guards: `tool_count_sync`, `config_drift`, `port_alignment`,
  `dockerfile_data_dir_alignment`, `compose_profile_sync`,
  `workflow_release_guards` (#261: auto-release workflow invariants + lockfile agreement),
  `report_train_failure` (#325: the release-train failure notifier),
  `bot_target_branch` (#265: dependabot blocks and the inert renovate config target develop), and
  `node_version_drift` (#275: `engines.node` is canonical; the Dockerfile `FROM node:` tags,
  every workflow's Node pin, and the README must agree with it. Run standalone with
  `npm run node-version-drift`).
- **Write-queue wakeup guard** (#278): `tests/unit/adapter_write_queue_wakeup.test.js` pins the
  lost-wakeup regression in `src/lib/actual-adapter.ts`. A write enqueued while a previous batch
  was draining used to be stranded (never dispatched, promise never settled) until an unrelated
  later write drained the queue. `withOpTimeout` (#270) cannot catch that: it bounds execution,
  not queue residency. The test also pins the debounce COALESCING property (5 same-tick writes
  produce exactly ONE batch, via `_getWriteQueueBatchCountForTests()`), because a fix that drained
  on every enqueue would close the deadlock and silently multiply init/sync cycles. Cases that
  depend on `ACTUAL_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` run in child processes: `config.ts` reads `process.env` once at
  module load, so an in-process env override is silently ignored and the assertion becomes vacuous.
- **Node floor guard** (#275): `tests/unit/node_version_guard.test.js` covers
  `src/lib/node-version-guard.ts`, which rejects an unsupported interpreter at startup rather
  than letting it die later with a cryptic `ERR_IMPORT_ASSERTION_TYPE_MISSING`. The unit test
  pins the comparator truth table, the fail-open behaviour on an unparseable range, that the
  floor is read from the ROOT `package.json` and not the stale `dist/package.json` mirror, and
  that the module stays dependency-free and stdout-clean. The `Node Floor Guard` CI job proves
  the guard actually fires by running both entry points on a real below-floor Node.
  The same file also covers #277: `--version`, the `--help` banner, and `actual_server_info`
  must all report the ROOT version, asserted on observable process output against a planted
  hostile `dist/package.json`, not by comparing resolver functions to each other. Removing the
  JSON imports from `src/index.ts` also stops `tsc` emitting that mirror in the first place.
- **Periodic deep sweep**: the manual `/code-health-auditor` skill runs Knip plus the drift
  guards, triages against the allowlist, and opens gate-ready tickets for genuine findings
  (cache-first via `docs/audit/deadcode-audit-cache.json`). Run on demand; not scheduled.
  It owns SOURCE dead code; `/dep-auditor` owns DEPENDENCY health.

### Manual Security Checks

```bash
# Check for exposed secrets
git grep -i "password\|token\|secret\|key" -- "*.ts" "*.js" "*.json"

# Verify .env not committed
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# Check Docker image vulnerabilities
docker scout cves actual-mcp-server:latest
```

### Security Testing Tools (Future)

Planned integrations:
- **Snyk**: Continuous security monitoring
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis security testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Current Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: schema/shape smoke tests + 23 negative-path assertions across 81 tools
- **Adapter Tests**: Infrastructure smoke (retry, concurrency, lifecycle), not per-tool
- **Docker E2E**: 68/70 tools with named tests (real Actual Budget server); 2 tools excluded (`budgets_list_available` and `budgets_switch` require ≥2 budgets, and the CI stack has 1). All 6 delete tools are named tests with list-absence assertions; `afterAll` is a safety fallback only.
- **Live Integration**: 81/81 tools called against real budget (all delete tools are named tests in `tests/manual/tests/`)

### Coverage Goals

| Test Type | Current | Target | Priority |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Unit Tests | 80% | 90% | High |
| Adapter Tests | 100% | 100% | Maintain |
| Integration Tests | 81/81 tools (live) | Maintain | Medium |
| E2E Tests | All 81 tools (Docker) | Maintain | Medium |

### Measuring Coverage

**Future Enhancement**: Add coverage reporting

```bash
# Planned - not yet implemented
npm run test:coverage

# Would output:
# File                 | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
# ---------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
# src/tools/*.ts       |   85.2  |   78.5   |   92.1  |   86.7  |
# src/lib/*.ts         |   91.3  |   88.2   |   94.5  |   92.1  |
```

**Tool Options**:
- `c8` - Built-in V8 coverage
- `nyc` - Istanbul coverage
- `jest` - Full test framework (if migrating)

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

**Stages**:
1. **Lint & Type Check** (3 min)
   - `tsc` - TypeScript compilation
   - `npm run check:coverage` - API coverage auditor: classifies every @actual-app/api method as covered (mapped to a tool), intentionally internal (lifecycle), or a genuine gap, sourcing the tool set from IMPLEMENTED_TOOLS so it cannot drift. Guarded by `tests/unit/check_coverage.test.js` (#187).
   - `npm audit` - Security audit (non-blocking)

2. **Test Suite** (3 min)
   - `npm run build` - Build project
   - `npm run test:adapter` - Adapter smoke tests
   - Upload test results

3. **E2E Tests** (5 min)
   - Playwright E2E test suite

4. **Build Artifacts** (3 min)
   - Build production distribution
   - Generate version info
   - Upload artifacts

5. **Docker Test Build** (2 min)
   - Build Docker image
   - Verify image starts
   - Test health endpoint

6. **Publish** (2 min)
   - Push to Docker Hub
   - Push to GitHub Container Registry
   - Create GitHub release

**Total Duration**: ~18 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- No TypeScript errors
- No high/critical vulnerabilities
- Docker build successful

### Local Pre-Push Testing

**Recommended**: Add pre-push hook

```bash
# .husky/pre-push (future enhancement)
#!/bin/sh
npm run build && npm run test:adapter && npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

---

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### TypeScript Compilation Errors

```bash
# Full error details
npm run build

# Common fixes:
# - Missing type definitions: npm install -D @types/package-name
# - Type mismatch: Check function signatures
# - Import errors: Verify file paths and extensions
```

### Adapter Test Failures

```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=true npm run test:adapter

# Check Actual Budget connection
npm run dev -- --test-actual-connection

# Verify environment variables
cat .env | grep ACTUAL_
```

### E2E Test Failures

```bash
# Run Playwright with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specific-test.spec.ts

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# View test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🔍 Test Writing Guidelines

### Unit Test Template

```javascript
// tests/unit/my_feature.test.js
import { test } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import { myFeature } from '../../dist/src/my-feature.js';

test('myFeature handles valid input', async () => {
  const result = await myFeature({ input: 'valid' });
  assert.strictEqual(result.success, true);
});

test('myFeature rejects invalid input', async () => {
  await assert.rejects(
    myFeature({ input: null }),
    /Input is required/
  );
});

test('myFeature handles edge cases', async () => {
  const result = await myFeature({ input: '' });
  assert.strictEqual(result.success, false);
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Names**: Test names explain what they verify
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
3. **One Assertion**: Each test verifies one thing
4. **No External Dependencies**: Mock external services
5. **Fast Execution**: Unit tests run in milliseconds

---

## 📝 Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

- **Adding features**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Fixing bugs**: Add regression test
- **Refactoring**: Ensure tests still pass
- **Changing behavior**: Update expected results

### Test Debt

Track test improvements:
- Missing test coverage
- Flaky tests
- Slow tests
- Brittle tests

---

## 🎯 Reliability Strategy

### Preventing Failures

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors at compile time
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks with proper error messages
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fail gracefully, not catastrophically

### Monitoring Production

- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for load balancers
- **Metrics**: `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus
- **Logging**: Structured logs with Winston
- **Alerts**: (Future) Alert on repeated failures

## Comprehensive Multi-Level Test Plan
### Test Pyramid Strategy

This project follows a comprehensive testing strategy with multiple levels, from unit tests to full E2E integration. Each level builds upon the previous, ensuring complete coverage of both success and failure scenarios.

### Level 1: Adapter Smoke Tests ⚡ (Fast: ~30s)

**Purpose:** Verify tool registration and basic functionality  
**Location:** `src/tests_adapter_runner.ts`  
**Command:** `npm run test:adapter`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ All 81 tools registered correctly
- ✅ Tool schemas valid (Zod validation)
- ✅ Tool descriptions present
- ✅ Basic tool invocation works

**Test Files:**
- `src/tests_adapter_runner.ts` - Main adapter test runner
- `tests/unit/generated_tools.smoke.test.js` - All 81 tools smoke validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All tools found in registry
- All tools have valid input schemas
- No TypeScript compilation errors

**Error Scenarios Tested:**
- ❌ Missing tool registration
- ❌ Invalid schema definitions
- ❌ Tool metadata missing

---

### Level 2: Unit Tests ⚡ (Fast: ~3s)

**Purpose:** Test individual components in isolation, fully offline, no Actual Budget server needed  
**Location:** `tests/unit/`  
**Command:** `npm run test:unit-js`

**Representative test files (the `test:unit-js` chain runs ~52):**

| File | What it tests | Assertions |
|---|---|---|
| `transactions_create.test.js` | Zod schema for `transactions_create`: valid input accepted, empty rejected | 2 |
| `generated_tools.smoke.test.js` | All 81 tools: stub adapter, `call()` succeeds, response shape verified per-tool | 81 + shape checks |
| `schema_validation.test.js` | Negative-path schema + runtime guards for 11+ tool schemas | 60+ |
| `schema_json_openai_compat.test.js` | Walks all 71 published `z.toJSONSchema()` outputs; asserts no `\p{...}` escape and every `pattern` compiles without the `u` flag, so no tool schema is rejected by OpenAI's Responses validator (#293) | 71 schemas |
| `unhandled-rejection.test.js` | Allow-list predicate for `process.on('unhandledRejection')`: production-shape secondary rejection swallowed; unrelated EACCES still exits; existing allow-list entries unchanged (#152) | 12 |
| `rejection-allowlist-purity.test.js` | Static analysis of `src/lib/rejection-allowlist.ts`: sentinel marker present; no static, dynamic, or CommonJS imports of non-node modules; no top-level side-effecting statements (#159) | 5 categories |
| `httpServer_bearer_auth.test.js` | Hardened bearer auth path: `timingSafeEqual` comparison with length-equality short-circuit; forbids re-introduction of token-content debug log lines (#157) | 12 |
| `adapter_write_pool_cooperation.test.js` | Write path uses the pool branch when a pooled session is in context: `writeConnectionReuses` increments; legacy branch otherwise; `api.sync()` runs in both branches (#158) | 7 |
| `budget_acl_enforcement.test.js` | Per-session active budget + ACL: stdio short-circuit; OIDC defence-in-depth refusal on missing allowedBudgets; allow on ACL match; warn-level structured denial log; `switchBudget` requires session, exact match only, releases pool entry before mutating session map (#156) | 15 |
| `workflow_release_guards.test.js` | Structural invariants of `dependency-update.yml` (#261): App-token-authenticated checkouts with credential persistence explicitly pinned on (#262: any `persist-credentials: false` spelling, or reliance on the upstream default, fails), no token-in-URL auth, lockfile resync inside the bump step, explicit sync control flow, Release gated behind the ci-cd watch guard, computed tool count; the behavioral lock-agreement check (package-lock.json version fields match package.json) that catches a stale-lock bump from any lane; and the #266 absence guard keeping the retired second auto-release lane retired (file gone, no tracked reference to its identifier under .claude/ or .github/, and no workflow_run trigger in any workflow) | 19 + 13 negative |
| `report_train_failure.test.js` | #325: the release-train failure notifier. Exercises the four pure decision functions of `scripts/report-train-failure.mjs` without network: outcome classification (the `TRAIN_OUTCOME` enum corroborated against the jobs API, unset and unrecognised failing toward notifying, an unattributed job cancel treated as a failure), full-semver validation gating the issue body sink rather than the notification, body construction from named fields only, and the total tracker state machine (open / update counter / converge duplicates / close / never reopen). Plus source-level invariants for the I/O layer: on-demand label creation, label-scoped close, no log endpoint is ever fetched, and the asymmetric error policy. Includes regression cases for four defects found in code review: a cancelled sibling job being attributed to the train, the reporter corroborating against its own job, a human triage note in the issue body being parsed as machine state, and `$` expansion corrupting the counter block. A second review pass added regressions for a sibling job with a failed step inverting a green train, a stale train-job name yielding no corroboration rather than wrong corroboration, and an unreadable version erasing a known-good one | 46 |
| `bot_target_branch.test.js` | #265: every dependabot update block carries target-branch develop and the inert renovate config's baseBranches includes develop with the activation warning; a bot PR against fast-forward-only main is structurally unmergeable | 2 + 2 negative |

**Coverage:**
- ✅ All 81 tools: stub invocation + response-shape assertion
- ✅ Schema parse rejection for empty/invalid inputs (11+ tools, 60+ cases)
- ✅ Runtime guard rejection: `amount ≤ 0`, `fromId === toId` in `budgets_transfer`
- ✅ Schema correctness: parse errors with provided examples surface as test failures

**Error Scenarios Tested:**
- ❌ Missing required fields (`conditions`, `operations`, `amount`, `month`, `categoryId`)
- ❌ Wrong types (string where number expected)
- ❌ Invalid format (month `2025-13`, `25-01`)
- ❌ Empty required strings
- ❌ Zero / negative amounts (runtime guard)
- ❌ Same source and target category (runtime guard)

---

### Level 3: Protocol E2E Tests ⚡ (Fast: ~10s)

**Purpose:** Verify MCP protocol compliance  
**Location:** `tests/e2e/mcp-client.playwright.spec.ts`  
**Command:** `npm run test:e2e`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ MCP initialization handshake
- ✅ tools/list request
- ✅ tools/call request
- ✅ Session management headers
- ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 format

**Test Scenarios:**

| Test | Success Case | Error Case |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Initialize | ✅ Valid protocol version | ❌ Unsupported version |
| List Tools | ✅ Returns 81 tools | ❌ Timeout |
| Call Tool | ✅ Executes tool | ❌ Tool not found |
| Session Persistence | ✅ Same session across calls | ❌ Session expired |
| Health Check | ✅ Status: ok | ❌ Status: not-initialized |

**Success Criteria:**
- All MCP protocol methods work
- JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance verified
- Session headers managed correctly

**Error Scenarios Tested:**
- ❌ Invalid JSON-RPC format
- ❌ Missing protocol version
- ❌ Invalid tool names
- ❌ Missing required parameters
- ❌ Server not initialized

---

### Level 5: Full Docker E2E Tests 🐳 (Thorough: ~60-120s)

**Purpose:** Test complete production deployment  
**Location:** `tests/e2e/docker.e2e.spec.ts` (smoke), `tests/e2e/docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` (comprehensive)  
**Command:** `npm run test:e2e:docker` OR `npx playwright test tests/e2e/docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Docker build correctness
- ✅ Container networking
- ✅ Real Actual Budget integration
- ✅ **ALL 81 tools execution (100% coverage)**
- ✅ Session management (including `actual_session_close`)
- ✅ Error handling (15+ error scenarios)
- ✅ Regression tests (strict validation, large batches, edge cases)

**Quick Smoke Tests (docker.e2e.spec.ts - 11 tests, ~20s):**

| # | Test Name | Success Scenario | Error Scenarios |
|---|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Initialize MCP session | ✅ Session created | ❌ Auth failure, timeout |
| 2 | Verify services healthy | ✅ Status: ok | ❌ Not initialized, Actual unreachable |
| 3 | List all tools | ✅ 81 tools returned | ❌ Timeout, server error |
| 4 | Execute actual_server_info | ✅ Server version returned | ❌ Connection refused |
| 5 | List accounts | ✅ Account array returned | ❌ Database error |
| 6 | Create test account | ✅ Account ID returned | ❌ Duplicate name, validation error |
| 7 | Verify session persistence | ✅ 3 consecutive calls work | ❌ Session timeout |
| 8 | *(removed: SSE transport removed)* | N/A | N/A |
| 9 | Docker build verification | ✅ All files present | ❌ Missing dependencies |
| 10 | Handle invalid tool name | ✅ Error: Tool not found | ❌ Unexpected behavior |
| 11 | Handle invalid arguments | ✅ Validation error returned | ❌ Server crash |

**Comprehensive All-Tools Tests (docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts - 80+ tests, ~120s):**

The authoritative per-domain breakdown lives in `tests/e2e/docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` (describe block `Docker E2E - ALL 81 TOOLS`): it exercises all 81 tools plus error scenarios. The per-category counts are not duplicated here, because a hand-maintained copy drifts.

**Success Criteria:**
- All 81 tools execute successfully
- Error scenarios handled gracefully
- Docker containers healthy
- No data corruption
- Complete cleanup after tests

**Error Scenarios Tested:**
- ❌ Invalid tool name (Tool not found)
- ❌ Missing required arguments (name, group_id, date)
- ❌ Invalid argument types (date format, amount format)
- ❌ Invalid field names (strict validation)
- ❌ Invalid queries (non-existent tables, invalid fields)
- ❌ Invalid join paths (account.id - account is field not join)
- ❌ Multiple invalid fields in query
- ❌ Invalid fields in WHERE clause
- ❌ Server not initialized (Health check fails)
- ❌ Session timeout (Network error)

**Query Validation Tests (11 scenarios):**
- ✅ Valid: SELECT * FROM transactions
- ✅ Valid: Specific fields (id, date, amount, account)
- ✅ Valid: Join paths (payee.name, category.name)
- ✅ Valid: WHERE and ORDER BY clauses
- ❌ Invalid: payee_name field (should suggest payee)
- ❌ Invalid: category_name field (should suggest category.name)
- ❌ Invalid: table name (transaction vs transactions)
- ❌ Invalid: field in WHERE clause
- ❌ Invalid: multiple invalid fields
- ❌ Invalid: join path account.id (account is not a join)

**Regression Scenarios Verified:**
- ✅ Strict validation on accounts_update (reject invalid fields)
- ✅ Strict validation on payees_update (reject invalid fields)
- ✅ Large batch operations (35+ operations)
- ✅ Rules without 'op' field (defaults to 'set')
- ✅ Payee updates with category field
- ✅ Session persistence across multiple calls

---

### Level 6: Manual Integration Tests 🧪 (Comprehensive: ~60s)

**Purpose:** Test all 81 tools with real Actual Budget data  
**Location:** `tests/manual/index.js` (entry point), `tests/manual/tests/` (14 domain modules)  
**Command:** `npm run test:integration:full`

> **`roundtrip.js` runs LAST and only at the `full` level (#332/#334).** `actual_budgets_import` creates a budget on the Actual server AND loads it, so anything scheduled after it would silently target the imported copy. The module switches back to the original configured budget before returning, but running it last is the primary defence. Its destructive half additionally requires `MCP_TEST_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` to be set, because the budget it creates is residue this suite has no tool to delete. Without that marker only the read-only export half runs.

### Test Execution Strategy

**Pre-Commit (Required):**
```bash
npm run build                    # TypeScript compilation
npm run test:adapter             # Smoke tests (30s)
npm run test:unit-js             # Unit tests (5s)
npm audit --audit-level=moderate # Security check
```

**Pre-Merge (CI/CD):**
```bash
npm run test:all                 # All automated tests (90s)
# Includes: adapter + unit + Docker E2E
```

**Pre-Release (Manual):**
```bash
# Full manual integration test with all 81 tools
npm run test:integration:full

# Cleanup only (remove leftover MCP-* test data)
npm run test:integration:cleanup
```

### Test Coverage Goals

| Test Level | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Level 1:** Adapter Smoke | 100% (adapter infra) | 100% | ✅ Maintain |
| **Level 2:** Unit Tests | 81/81 tools (stub), 23 schema assertions | Maintain + grow | ✅ Good |
| **Level 3:** Live Integration | 81/81 tools called | 81/81 | ✅ Maintain |
| **Level 4:** Protocol E2E | 100% (MCP compliance) | 100% | ✅ Maintain |
| **Level 5:** Docker E2E | **68/70 tools** (100% named; 2 excluded for single-budget CI) | 100% | ✅ Maintain |
| **Level 6:** Manual Full | 100% (81/81 tools) | 100% | ✅ Maintain |
| **Error Scenarios** | ~70% | 90% | 🟡 Medium |

### Next Testing Improvements

**High Priority:**
1. ✅ **Completed:** Docker E2E tests with 68/70 tools named (2 excluded: `budgets_list_available`, `budgets_switch` due to single-budget CI constraint)
2. ✅ **Completed:** Unit test suite (~52 files), 81-tool smoke, 23 negative-path assertions
3. ✅ **Completed:** All 6 delete tools promoted to named E2E tests with list-absence assertions; `afterAll` is now fallback-only
4. ✅ **Completed:** Shared `tests/shared/mcp-protocol.js` utility (MCP envelope parsing, reused across E2E and integration tests)
5. ⏳ **TODO:** Add business logic error tests (duplicate accounts, insufficient funds)
6. ⏳ **TODO:** Add concurrency tests (parallel tool execution)

**Medium Priority:**
5. ⏳ **TODO:** Add chaos testing (server failures, network issues)
6. ⏳ **TODO:** Add performance benchmarks (tool execution time)
7. ⏳ **TODO:** Add load testing (concurrent sessions)

**Low Priority:**
8. ⏳ **TODO:** Add mutation testing (verify test quality)
9. ⏳ **TODO:** Add contract testing (API compatibility)
10. ⏳ **TODO:** Add visual regression testing (Docker dashboard)

## ✨ Summary

**Testing is mandatory, not optional.**

Before every commit:
```bash
npm run build && npm run test:adapter && npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

If tests fail:
1. ❌ Do not commit
2. ✅ Fix the issue
3. ✅ Re-run tests
4. ✅ Commit only when all tests pass

**Remember**: Tests are your safety net. Maintaining them ensures long-term project health and enables confident development.
