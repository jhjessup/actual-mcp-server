# AI Client Setup Guide

This guide covers connecting AI clients (LibreChat, LobeChat, or any MCP-compatible client) to the Actual MCP Server.

## Prerequisites

- Actual MCP Server running and reachable (see [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md))
- Health check passing: `curl http://localhost:3600/health`
- A Bearer token configured if auth is enabled (`MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION`)

---

## Connection Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐   MCP/HTTP   ┌──────────────────┐   Actual API   ┌──────────────┐
│  AI Client  │ ◄──────────► │  Actual MCP      │ ◄───────────► │   Actual     │
│ (LibreChat  │              │  Server          │               │   Budget     │
│  LobeChat)  │              │  (81 tools)      │               │   Server     │
└─────────────┘              └──────────────────┘               └──────────────┘
```

The AI client communicates with the MCP server over **HTTP** using the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. The MCP server translates natural language tool calls into Actual Budget API requests.

---

## Docker Networking: Internal Hostnames

**When both the AI client and MCP server run in Docker**, always use **internal container hostnames**, not host IP addresses.

| | URL |
|---|---|
| ✅ Correct | `http://actual-mcp-server-backend:3600/http` |
| ❌ Avoid | `http://192.168.1.x:3600/http` |

**Why internal hostnames are better:**
- Direct container-to-container communication (no host bridge hop)
- Resilient to host IP changes
- No external network exposure
- Lower latency

Both containers must share the same Docker network. See [network configuration](#docker-network-configuration) below.

---

## LibreChat Setup

Edit your `librechat.yaml`:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  actual-mcp:
    type: "streamable-http"
    # Use container hostname if on same Docker network, otherwise use host IP/domain
    url: "http://actual-mcp-server-backend:3600/http"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    serverInstructions: true
    timeout: 600000  # 10 minutes (budget operations can be slow)
```

Then restart LibreChat:

```bash
docker restart ai-librechat
```

Verify tools loaded. In the LibreChat UI you should see **81 tools** listed under the MCP server entry.

### LibreChat with OIDC

When `AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc` is set on the MCP server, configure the OIDC MCP instance via the LibreChat admin UI (OAuth flow). For a static-token fallback, add to `librechat.yaml`:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  actual-bearer:
    type: "http"
    url: "http://actual-mcp-server-backend:3600/http"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer your_token_here"
    serverInstructions: false
```

---

## LobeChat Setup

In the LobeChat UI:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Language Model** → **Model Context Protocol**
2. Click **Add Plugin**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `Actual Budget MCP`
   - **Server Type**: `HTTP`
   - **Server URL**: `http://actual-mcp-server-backend:3600/http`
   - **Authorization**: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
4. Click **Save**

LobeChat will automatically discover all 81 tools.

---

## Docker Network Configuration

Both the MCP server and AI client containers must be on the same Docker network:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
networks:
  ai-network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  librechat:           # or lobe-chat
    networks:
      - ai-network

  actual-mcp-server-backend:
    image: ghcr.io/agigante80/actual-mcp-server:latest
    networks:
      - ai-network
    environment:
      - ACTUAL_SERVER_URL=http://actual-server:5006
      - ACTUAL_PASSWORD=${ACTUAL_PASSWORD}
      - ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID=${ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID}
      - MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION=${MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION}
    volumes:
      - actual-mcp-data:/app/data
```

Verify connectivity from the AI client container:

```bash
docker exec <ai-container> wget -qO- http://actual-mcp-server-backend:3600/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","initialized":true,...}
```

---

## HTTPS / TLS Setup

HTTPS is **not required** for internal Docker-to-Docker communication. Use it only if:
- The AI client accesses the MCP server from outside the Docker network
- You are exposing the server to the internet
- Compliance requirements mandate encryption

> **Note:** Native TLS is supported. Set `MCP_ENABLE_HTTPS=true`, `MCP_HTTPS_CERT`, and `MCP_HTTPS_KEY`. For multi-domain or certificate rotation use cases a reverse proxy is still preferred; set `MCP_BRIDGE_USE_TLS=true` so the server advertises the correct `https://` URL when TLS is terminated upstream.

### Option A: Docker Internal Network (Recommended; No HTTPS Needed)

If both containers share a Docker network, HTTP is sufficient. Internal Docker traffic does not leave the host machine.

### Option B: Reverse Proxy with TLS (External Access)

Run any reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) to terminate TLS, forwarding to the MCP server's HTTP port.

**Example: Caddy**

```
actual-mcp.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3600
}
```

**Example: nginx**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name actual-mcp.yourdomain.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/actual-mcp.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/actual-mcp.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3600;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Set `MCP_BRIDGE_USE_TLS=true` in your `.env` so the MCP server advertises `https://` in its URL. Then update your AI client config to use `https://`:

```yaml
# LibreChat
url: "https://actual-mcp.yourdomain.com/http"
```

### Option C: Let's Encrypt (Production)

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d actual-mcp.yourdomain.com
```

## OIDC Authentication (Multi-User)

> **This is inbound auth only.** `AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc` controls how MCP **clients** authenticate
> **to this server**. It does not change how this server authenticates **to Actual Budget**, which
> is always `ACTUAL_PASSWORD`. The two are independent: you can run OIDC here with a
> password-authenticated Actual upstream, and enabling OIDC on your Actual Budget server does not
> remove this server's need for `ACTUAL_PASSWORD`. A third credential,
> `ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASSWORD`, is unrelated to both: it decrypts an E2E-encrypted budget file.

For multi-user deployments with an OIDC provider (Casdoor, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.):

```bash
# .env
AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso.yourdomain.com
OIDC_RESOURCE=your-client-id          # must match 'aud' claim in JWT
OIDC_SCOPES=                          # leave empty for Casdoor (no 'scope' claim)
# Only for IdPs whose JWKS lives on a different host than the issuer (#254).
# Google: issuer accounts.google.com serves keys from www.googleapis.com:
# OIDC_JWKS_TRUSTED_HOSTS=www.googleapis.com
```

**Per-user budget access control** (`AUTH_BUDGET_ACL`):

```bash
# Restrict which budgets each user can access
# Format: JSON object, principal → list of sync IDs or ["*"] for all
AUTH_BUDGET_ACL={"alice@example.com":["budget-uuid-1"],"group:admins":["*"]}
```

Principal key formats:
- `"alice@example.com"`: matches the `email` claim
- `"some-sub-uuid"`: matches the `sub` claim
- `"group:admin"`: matches an element in `groups` or `roles` array

**Casdoor note**: Casdoor JWTs do not include a `scope` claim. Set `OIDC_SCOPES=` (empty string) to disable scope enforcement.

**OAuth discovery for Claude.ai / mcp-remote (#285)**: with `AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`, the server automatically publishes both OAuth metadata documents a client needs to start a login: `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728) and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414). The RFC 8414 document is re-served from your IdP's own OpenID discovery doc, which lets clients that resolve that path against the resource-server origin (and IdPs like Authentik that do not expose it where clients look) complete the flow. No configuration is required: point your OIDC client at the server's base URL and it discovers `OIDC_ISSUER`'s `authorization_endpoint` / `token_endpoint` automatically. If a client cannot find the token endpoint against a bare-OIDC IdP, confirm `AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc` is set (the endpoints exist only in OIDC mode).

---

## Verification

After connecting an AI client, verify:

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl http://localhost:3600/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","initialized":true,...}

# 2. Tools loaded (should list 81 tools)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3600/http \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'{len(data[\"result\"][\"tools\"])} tools loaded')"
```

In your AI client you should see:
- ✅ 81 tools loaded with `actual_` prefix
- ✅ `actual_server_info` tool available
- ✅ Natural language queries returning results

### Tested Configurations

| Configuration | Result | Tools Loaded |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP, no auth | ✅ | 70 |
| HTTP + Bearer token | ✅ | 70 |
| HTTP + OIDC (Casdoor v2.13) | ✅ | 70 |

## Session Recovery After a Server Restart

The HTTP transport is stateful: each client connection gets an `mcp-session-id`, and the live session lives in the server process memory. When the container is recreated (an env change, an image update, a host reboot), those in-memory sessions are gone. A client that reuses its cached `mcp-session-id` then receives the MCP spec signal:

```
HTTP 404  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32001,"message":"Session not found. Please re-initialize ..."}}
```

**A session that was never usable reports why (#438).** The 404 above means the session is simply gone. A different case looks identical to a client but is not: the session was created, its connection to Actual failed to initialise, and the transport was never registered. Since #438 that answer names the cause instead of the generic sentence:

```
HTTP 404  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{
  "code": -32001,
  "message": "The Actual server's database schema is newer than the @actual-app/api this build bundles. ... Please re-initialize by calling initialize without an mcp-session-id header once the cause is fixed.",
  "data": { "cause": "schema_too_new", "sessionInitFailed": true }
}}
```

`data.cause` is a CLOSED enum, safe to branch on: `schema_too_new`, `auth_failed`, `network_unreachable`, `budget_not_found`, `out_of_sync`, `encryption_error`, `clock_drift`, `permission_denied`, `timeout`, `unknown`. `data.sessionInitFailed` distinguishes this case from an ordinary expired session. The message carries no upstream error text by design, so it never leaks server paths, SQL or URLs; the full error is in the server log. The record lives 60 seconds, after which the generic body returns.

The client action is the same in both cases (re-initialize), but `sessionInitFailed: true` means a bare retry will fail again until the underlying cause is fixed, so a client should surface the message rather than silently looping.

What a spec-compliant client should do on that 404 is send a fresh `initialize` (without an `mcp-session-id` header), cache the new id, and retry. The server cannot resurrect the old session id: the MCP SDK assigns a session id only during `initialize` and validates later requests by exact match, with no way to re-adopt a previously issued id.

To make that recovery cheap (a quiet re-initialize, not a full sign-in), keep the OAuth token decoupled from the MCP session:

- **Token lifetime and refresh:** configure your OIDC provider (e.g. Logto) so access tokens outlive a typical restart and the client holds a refresh token. With a valid cached/refreshed token, the post-404 `initialize` does not trigger a new consent screen. The server validates whatever token arrives on every request, so it never forces a re-consent on its own.
- **Avoid needless recreates:** most settings do not require recreating the container; prefer a reload where possible.
- **Known client limitation:** some clients (including the Claude app and Claude Code, per upstream reports) do not yet auto re-initialize on a 404 and require a manual reconnect of the connector. That is a client-side gap, not a server one; the server already returns the correct signal.

**Active budget after recovery:** the server remembers each authenticated principal's last selected budget (keyed by a SHA-256 hash of the principal, never the raw identity) and restores it on the new session, after re-checking the live access list. So a user who switched budgets keeps that budget across a restart, provided their ACL still permits it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Tools don't load in AI client | Wrong URL or network | Verify `curl` health check works from the AI container |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Token mismatch | Check `MCP_SSE_AUTHORIZATION` matches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| Timeout errors | Slow Actual Budget server | Increase `timeout` in client config (default: 10 min) |
| `connection refused` | MCP server not running | Check `docker logs actual-mcp-server-backend` |
| 0 tools loaded | Wrong transport type | Ensure `type: "streamable-http"` (not `"sse"`) in LibreChat config |
