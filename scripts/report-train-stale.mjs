//
// #327: #325 reports a train that FAILED. It cannot report a train that never
// RAN, which lands in the same found-by-eye state it was filed to fix.
//
// Two causes, both verified:
//   1. GitHub disables scheduled workflows in PUBLIC repositories after 60 days
//      of repository inactivity. This repo is public, so the rule applies. It is
//      the lower-probability cause here, because near-daily commits keep the
//      clock resetting.
//   2. Cron dispatches are delayed under load and DROPPED under sufficiently
//      high load. GitHub does not guarantee a scheduled run fires. This is the
//      live cause.
//
// TWO SIGNALS, deliberately, because they detect disjoint failures:
//   - `state` catches a workflow that has been DISABLED. It is immediate,
//     scalar, threshold-free, and directly observable from the Actions API.
//   - recency catches a workflow that is `active` but is not firing anyway.
// Recency alone was the original proposal and is the worse primary: it is a
// derived proxy that cannot fire until the threshold has elapsed.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE REPORTER, and not a `stale` member of TRAIN_OUTCOME.
// Trace classifyOutcome's gate order in report-train-failure.mjs: cancelled,
// not-in-KNOWN_OUTCOMES, equals 'failure', corroboration, equals 'success',
// fall-through.
//   - `stale` WITHOUT adding it to KNOWN_OUTCOMES trips gate 2 and files a
//     mislabelled "the release train failed" issue pointing at the wrong run.
//   - `stale` ADDED to KNOWN_OUTCOMES passes gate 2, fails 3/4/5, and falls
//     through to {action:'ignore'}: exit 0, green, NOTHING FILED. That is the
//     exact defect this ticket exists to eliminate, reproduced inside its own fix.
// This is the INVERSE of the noop_soaking lesson, where omission caused a false
// P1 nightly. There the fix was to add the member; here adding it is the silent
// branch. Two mitigations pulling opposite ways is a design smell, so the
// classifier is separate rather than a judgement call left to an implementer.
//
// ITS OWN LABEL, for the same reason. Sharing #325's `train-failure` marker
// would mean this reporter's healthy path hits decideTransition's `close_all`
// and closes every open train-failure issue with a comment falsely asserting
// recovery. Because ci-cd.yml runs on every push to develop, a genuine
// unresolved failure would be auto-closed within minutes of the next routine
// push. That would delete the notification #325 exists to provide.
