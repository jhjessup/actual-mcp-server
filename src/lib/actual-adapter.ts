 * full listing to decide whether its target exists. `db.getPayees()` is a LEFT JOIN over
 * accounts with an ORDER BY and a per-row model map, so a 200-payee bulk rename was paying
 * 200 of them, inside the api mutex. Measured on develop before this change: two guarded
 * updates in ONE drain cost TWO listings.
 *
 * WHY THE SCOPE IS EXACTLY ONE DRAIN, AND NEVER WIDER. A drain holds the api lock for its
 * whole body and is by construction one consistent session, so a listing taken at its start
 * is valid for its duration ONCE writes invalidate it. Anything wider would serve one
 * session's data to another session or another budget, which is a data-disclosure bug, not
 * a staleness bug. The cache therefore lives in an AsyncLocalStorage entered by the drain
 * itself, so it exists only for the duration of that run and there is no assignment for any
 * path, fatal or otherwise, to leave behind. (This sentence used to describe a module-level
 * variable cleared in a `finally`; that is what the store replaced.)
 *
 * WHY INVALIDATION IS NOT OPTIONAL. A cache without it converts an occasional race into a
 * guaranteed false not-found: a create early in the drain would be invisible to every later
 * guard. `invalidateDrainListing` is called by the write helpers below.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, deliberately. Memoisation makes the reads cheap and mutually
 * consistent. It does NOT order them. The sibling-operation race (a delete and an update of
 * the same entity in one batch) is an ORDERING problem and is fixed by dispatching the batch
 * sequentially, further down. Both are needed and neither substitutes for the other.

 * `withConcurrency(() => retry(() => readDrainListing(...)))`, and `withConcurrency` queues a
 * plain closure on a module-level array when saturated, invoking it from ANOTHER task's
 * `.finally()`, so a queued task runs in the releasing task's async context. The store
 * survives that today by arrangement rather than by construction: the drain holds the api lock
 * for its whole body, so every limiter task inside it is already a drain-context task. If that
 * ever stops being true the failure is SILENT and benign (a pass-through: correct but slow,
 * never a wrong or foreign cache, since readDrainListing has no caller outside a drain op), so
 * case (11) of the drain-cache test squeezes the limiter to 1 and counts the listings. `requestContext` is a separate store carrying the sessionId; this one deliberately

/**
 * #388: turn an optional FILTER id that is actually a NAME into a refusal that names the id.
 *
 * Every Category B field routes through here, so the surface has ONE answer to the single most
 * likely caller mistake instead of the three it had (a helpful resolution in one tool, a bare
 * not-found in another, and a silent empty result set in the other nine).
 *
 * COSTS NOTHING ON THE HAPPY PATH. A well-formed id returns immediately, with no listing read,
 * so a correct call is byte-identical to before. Only a non-id value pays a listing, and only
 * because the alternative is answering it with an empty result the caller will read as "no
 * matches".
 *
 * It lives in the adapter rather than in the ten tool files for the reason #371 and #376 both
 * landed on: a check the tools share belongs where the reads keep `retry` and the observability
 * call site, and where the next caller of the same listing cannot skip it by accident.
 *
 * It THROWS rather than returning a result envelope, per #377's taxonomy: does-not-exist throws,
 * and `{ success: false }` is only for a genuine multi-outcome contract. A filter id that names
 * nothing is not a multi-outcome contract. That is also why the four tools that already had an
 * accommodation stop returning `{ transactions: [], count: 0, error }`: an empty result set with
 * an error tucked inside it is the shape this ticket exists to remove, not a milder version of it.
 *
 * `verifyExists` EXISTS SO THIS CHANGE REMOVES NOTHING, and the asymmetry is deliberate rather
 * than an oversight, so do not "tidy" it into one behaviour without deciding the same question
 * again. Five tools already read the listing unconditionally and already refuse a well-formed id
 * that names nothing; they pass `verifyExists: true` and keep exactly that, with a better message.
 * The rest never paid a listing read, and making them pay one on EVERY call to catch a mistyped
 * UUID would impose a cost on every correct call to fix a mistake nobody makes. The mistake that
 * actually happens, and that this ticket is about, is a NAME passed where an id belongs, which is
 * caught on both paths because a name is never a UUID.
 *
 * `acceptsName` IS NOT A SOFTER `verifyExists`, and the difference is a CONTRACT difference
 * rather than a preference. The fields #388 was written for publish themselves as ids, so a name
 * is a caller mistake and the only honest answer is a refusal that hands back the id. Three
 * fields publish themselves as NAMES or as "id or name" — `transactions_search_by_category`'s
 * `categoryName`, `transactions_search_by_payee`'s `payeeName`/`categoryName`, and
 * `transactions_update`'s `fields.payee` — and for those a name is the documented input, so
 * refusing it would break the published contract rather than enforce it. Passing `acceptsName`
 * makes an UNAMBIGUOUS name resolve to its id and be returned. Everything else is unchanged:
 * a well-formed id is still verified, an unknown value still refuses, and an AMBIGUOUS name
 * still refuses (naming every candidate), because picking one would be the silent wrong answer
 * this whole resolver exists to remove.

 * row was absent. The accounts table has no NOT NULL columns and `tombstone` defaults to 0,
 * while `getAccounts()` filters `tombstone = 0`, so reopening an id that is not an account
 * CREATES a visible nameless account that syncs to every client.
 *
 * A pre-check is right here and was wrong in #347: there, the caller's intent ("make this
 * account not exist") could already be satisfied by an absent row, so refusing on absence
 * would have failed a complete request. Here the intent ("reopen this account") cannot be
 * satisfied by an absent row, and proceeding actively creates one.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE LIMITS, carried over from the tool-layer version so they are not
 * rediscovered as oversights.
 *
 * One `queueWriteOperation` keeps this read, write and re-read in a single api lock cycle.
 *
 * #378 CORRECTED WHAT THAT IS WORTH, and this paragraph used to say the opposite. It read:
 * "It does NOT serialise against other operations in the same batch: processWriteQueue
 * dispatches with Promise.allSettled, so operations queued in the same drain window
 * interleave at await points. The cycle excludes other SESSIONS, not batch siblings."
 * That was accurate, and it was a live hazard rather than a footnote: a same-drain delete of
 * the same account would let this guard's pre-read pass and the write proceed against a row
 * that no longer existed. The batch now dispatches SEQUENTIALLY in enqueue order, so the
 * cycle excludes batch siblings too. Restoring the concurrent dispatch reopens it, and
 * tests/unit/adapter_drain_listing_cache.test.js goes red across its create-then-update,
 * delete-then-update and ordering cases if you do. Not quoting a count on purpose: this
 * comment and its CLAUDE.md twin both drifted on one within this ticket.
 *
 * The not-found message covers both reasons an id can be missing (never existed, or removed
 * by a close while it had no transactions) rather than distinguishing them. `q().withDead()`
 * would tell them apart by reading tombstoned rows, at the cost of an extra query on the
 * failure path. Collapsing them was chosen because the message names both cases and the
 * remedy is the same either way.
