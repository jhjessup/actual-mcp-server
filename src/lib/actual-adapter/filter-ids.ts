/**
 * #388: what an OPTIONAL FILTER id means when the caller passes a NAME.
 *
 * The surface used to answer that question three different ways, and the inconsistency was the
 * real defect rather than the schema question that surfaced it:
 *
 *   1. `transactions_search_by_amount` DETECTED the name, looked it up, and answered with the
 *      correct UUID. Strictly the most useful thing any of them did.
 *   2. `transactions_get` pre-flighted and returned `notFoundMsg`, naming the entity and the
 *      listing tool but not resolving the name.
 *   3. Everything else silently returned an EMPTY result set, which is the worst of the three:
 *      a plausible-looking wrong answer that reads as "no transactions match".
 *
 * #380 swept the REQUIRED lookup ids onto `CommonSchemas` and deliberately left these behind,
 * because tightening them is a contract decision rather than a sweep. Tightening alone (making
 * the schema reject a non-UUID) would have deleted accommodation 1, trading the best message on
 * the surface for a ZodError. So the schema stays a bare string and the answer moves here.
 *
 * THE FAST PATH READS NOTHING. A value that is already a UUID is returned untouched, without a
 * listing call, so a correct call costs exactly what it costs today. The listing read happens
 * only on the unhappy path, where the caller has already made a mistake and the alternative is
 * a wrong answer.
 *
 * This module is deliberately PURE so it can be unit-tested without an api session; the adapter
 * owns the impure half (fetching the listing) because that is where a listing read gets `retry`
 * and the observability call site, and because #371 and #376 concluded that a check the tools
 * share belongs in the adapter rather than copied into ten tool files.

 * THIS USED TO RETURN THE FIRST MATCH ONLY, and the reason it no longer does is worth keeping.
 * #388 argued that reporting the first was "strictly better than the empty result set this
 * replaces", which was true of the change it was making and is not an argument that the first
 * match is the RIGHT answer. Actual permits two categories with the same name in different
 * groups, so a name is not a key; when it matches twice, naming one id and hedging with "if that
 * is not the category you meant" hands a model a specific id and a vague doubt, and a model
 * resolves that by using the id. The candidates are already in `rows` — the listing has been read
 * — so disclosing them costs nothing that has not already been paid for, and it is the only
