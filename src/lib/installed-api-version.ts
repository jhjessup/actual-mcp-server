/**
 * #439: resolve the version of `@actual-app/api` this process actually has
 * installed, as opposed to the range `package.json` declares.
 *
 * WHY NOT the obvious routes, all verified rather than assumed:
 *  - `require.resolve('@actual-app/api/package.json')` throws
 *    ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED: the package does not export that subpath.
 *  - The module's own `VERSION` export is `undefined`, and the bundle carries an
 *    unrelated third-party `VERSION` string, so reading it could silently yield a
 *    wrong version.
 *  - `package.json` holds a CARET RANGE, so the installed version is unknowable
 *    at our build time and cannot be baked in.
 * So: resolve the entry point, then walk up to the nearest `package.json` whose
 * `name` matches, mirroring the shape of node-version-guard.ts.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS SILENT. It emits nothing: no `console.*`, no logger import, no
 * direct stdout or stderr write. At module load there is no injected logger, and
 * on stdio stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC framing, so a stray write would
 * corrupt the protocol with nothing to catch it. A failure returns null.
 *
 * The `try/catch` and the memoisation both live HERE rather than in the caller,
 * so every consumer imports a value that cannot throw. That matters beyond the
 * adapter: #445 will make `src/tools/server_info.ts` a second consumer, and that
 * file is reachable from `src/tools/index.ts` into `actualToolsManager`, where an
 * uncaught resolution throw would break TOOL REGISTRATION rather than merely the
 * adapter. Resolving once at load also keeps a blocking `readFileSync` out of the
 * per-operation path, which runs inside the process-global api mutex.
