/**
 * MCP tool annotations for the 74-tool surface (#379).
 *
 * The Model Context Protocol lets a server describe each tool's NATURE to clients, so a
 * model or a UI can know which tools mutate a budget BEFORE calling one. This file is the
 * single source of that classification, and `ActualMCPConnection` attaches it to every
 * `tools/list` entry.
 *
 * THE SPEC'S DEFAULTS ARE ALREADY CONSERVATIVE, which shapes what is worth declaring.
 * From `schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts`:
 *
 *   readOnlyHint     default false   "the tool does not modify its environment"
 *   destructiveHint  default TRUE    "may perform destructive updates"; only meaningful when readOnlyHint is false
 *   idempotentHint   default false   "calling repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect"
 *   openWorldHint    default TRUE    "may interact with an open world of external entities"
 *
 * So a tool that declares nothing is already treated as write-capable, destructive and
 * open-world. The value here is therefore NOT warning about the dangerous tools; it is
 * telling clients which tools are SAFE, and correcting `openWorldHint`, whose default is
 * wrong for 73 of our 74 tools: this server's domain is one Actual Budget instance, a
 * CLOSED world. Only `actual_bank_sync` reaches outside it, to GoCardless or SimpleFIN.
 *
 * THESE ARE HINTS, NEVER A GUARD. The spec is explicit: "all properties in ToolAnnotations
 * are hints. They are not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior",
 * and "Clients should never make tool use decisions based on ToolAnnotations received from
 * untrusted servers." Nothing in `src/` may branch on an annotation. Authorisation stays in
 * `budget-acl.ts`, and refusal stays in the adapter guards.
 *
 * WHY A CENTRAL TABLE rather than a field on each tool. `types/tool.d.ts` is in CLAUDE.md's
 * do-not-modify tier, and most tools use the legacy `ToolDefinition` shape, so a per-tool
 * `annotations` field needs that permission first. A table also puts the whole
 * classification on one screen next to the reasoning, which is what makes it auditable
 * against `docs/audit/write-effect-audit.md`, and `tests/unit/tool_annotations.test.js`
 * makes omission impossible. Moving to per-tool declarations later is mechanical.
 */

 * Claimed only where it is certain. Three read-path tools are deliberately absent because
 * "does not modify its environment" is false for them, and a wrong `true` here is worse
 * than no annotation at all:
 *
 *   actual_bank_sync       runs through `withActualApi` (the read path) but IMPORTS
 *                          transactions, so the call graph says read and reality says
 *                          write. Reality wins.
 *   actual_budgets_export  writes a zip into the server's data directory.
 *   actual_budgets_switch  changes the session's active budget and persists a preference.
 *   actual_session_close   closes a pooled connection: server state, not budget data.

/**
 * Write tools where repeating the SAME call leaves the same STATE.
 *
 * THE STANDARD USED, because it is the judgement call in this file. The spec says
 * idempotent means "calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments will have no
 * additional effect on the its environment". That is about STATE, not about the response,
 * so a tool that refuses the second call while changing nothing still qualifies. This
 * matters most for the delete family: since #376/#377 they THROW a NotFoundRefusal for an
 * absent id rather than reporting success, but the second call writes nothing, so the state
 * after one delete and after five is identical. A client deciding whether a timed-out write
 * is safe to retry cares about the state, which is exactly what this flag answers.
 *
 * Values are taken from `docs/audit/write-effect-audit.md` rather than guessed, so each one
 * has a history behind it.
 *
 * The exclusions are the point:
 *   most `*_create`             each call makes ANOTHER entity, so the state differs
 *   budgets_holdForNextMonth    upstream ADDS to the buffer, so a retry holds twice (#355)
 *   budgets_transfer            moves money again on each call
 *   payees_merge                the sources are gone after the first
 *   bank_sync                   imports whatever is new upstream
 *   transactions_import         adds rows; de-dup is a bank-sync property, not a promise here
 *
 * `actual_tags_create` is the create that IS idempotent, and it is easy to miss: it upserts
 * on the tag word, so a repeat updates the existing tag and returns the same id. Its own
 * description says so and `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` asserts it. `categories_create` is
 * deliberately NOT here: it REJECTS a duplicate rather than upserting, and whether upstream
 * truly refuses every duplicate is not something this file should assume.

  // spec asks whether repeating leaves the same STATE (a second delete writes nothing),

  // reading this flag to decide "auto-retry after a timeout?" should still respect #165, so
  // the two lists disagreeing on paper is expected and is recorded here rather than left to
  // be re-litigated.
