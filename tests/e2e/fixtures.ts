/**
 * tests/e2e/fixtures.ts
 *
 * Playwright fixtures that make every E2E test self-provisioning (#375).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THESE SOLVE. `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` used to be 100+ ordered
 * tests sharing one mutable `testContext` object: a test created an entity, wrote
 * its id into that object, and later tests read it behind
 * `if (!testContext.accountId) test.skip()`. Correctness depended on file order,
 * running one test alone SKIPPED it, and any test that mutated the shared fixture
 * silently changed what every later test saw.
 *
 * That coupling produced three real failures, each of which was a green test that
 * had been passing for the wrong reason:
 *
 *   1. The shared account was created with `balance: 0` and closed before any
 *      transaction existed. Actual TOMBSTONES a zero-transaction account on close,
 *      so every later test reusing that id operated on an account that no longer
 *      existed, and passed because the tools silently accepted the dead id.
 *   2. `transactions_uncategorized` asserted against an account an earlier test had
 *      set `offbudget: true`, which that tool deliberately excludes. It only passed
 *      because of defect 1.
 *   3. In the manual suite, a transfer left the shared account with a non-zero
 *      balance, so a teardown far away stopped working and the run failed its
 *      zero-residue assertion.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS ESTABLISHES. A test asks for what it needs and gets a fresh one:
 *
 *   test('...', async ({ mcp, makeAccount }) => {
 *     const account = await makeAccount();
 *     ...
 *   });
 *
 * Everything a factory creates is removed in fixture teardown, which runs even
 * when the test fails, so a failing test cannot leak residue into the next one.
 *
 * WHY A SINGLE PRIORITY-ORDERED REGISTRY rather than per-factory teardown.
 * Playwright unwinds fixtures in reverse setup order, which is the order the TEST
 * happened to declare them, not the order Actual's referential integrity needs.
 * Deletes have a required order here (transactions, then rules, then payees, then
 * categories, then groups, then accounts), so all factories share one `cleanup`
 * registry that sorts by that priority. `cleanup` is a dependency of every factory,
 * so it is set up first and therefore torn down last.
