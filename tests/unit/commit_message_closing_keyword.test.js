// #405: a commit message must not be able to close a ticket its author is leaving open.
//
// GitHub reads a closing keyword followed by an issue reference as an instruction to close, and it
// does not care that the surrounding sentence says the opposite. The close fires when the commit
// reaches the DEFAULT BRANCH, which in this repo means during a release, days after the commit was
// written, looking in the timeline exactly like a deliberate close.
//
// It fired THREE times in one afternoon: #391 (via 6d61c750, released as v0.16.5), #414 (via
// 320ea7d, v0.16.7) and #416 (via e5b08a9, v0.16.8). The second and third happened after the hazard
// had been filed as this ticket AND written into the project's memory, by the same author, using
// the same phrase. That is the argument for a hook rather than a convention: a rule its own author
// breaks twice within two hours of writing it down is not a control.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/commit_message_closing_keyword.test.js
