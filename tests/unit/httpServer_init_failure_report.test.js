//
// #438: a session whose Actual init failed must report WHY, instead of the
// client's next request getting a bare "Session not found".
//
// Reproduced before the fix, end to end against the real server: booting with
// ACTUAL_SERVER_URL pointing at a closed port makes connectToActualForSession
// genuinely throw; `initialize` still returned SUCCESS, and the next request
// returned only `-32001 Session not found`, while the server log held
// "Authentication failed: network-failure". After the fix the same run returns
// the network_unreachable cause and its sentence.
//
// Two-pronged, matching this repo's convention for httpServer tests:
//   1. The classifier is a PURE EXPORTED function, called directly with
//      synthetic values. This is deliberate: there is NO fault-injection seam in
//      actualConnection.ts or the pool, and a closed-port boot reaches only
//      `network-failure`, so every other class is unreachable end to end.
//   2. Static source guards for the properties a behavioural test cannot see:
//      the record's bound, peek-not-consume, containment, and above all that no
//      upstream-derived string can reach the wire.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/httpServer_init_failure_report.test.js
