//
// #380: an id-shaped field in a tool schema must use CommonSchemas, or be on the documented
// exception list below.
//
// WHY. Before this, the surface described the same concept FOUR different ways: the shared
// schema, an inline `UUID_PATTERN` regex meaning the identical thing, a bounded
// `z.string().min(1).max(64)` from #356, and a bare `z.string()`. 33 of 41 id fields were on
// one of the loose forms, so `actual_accounts_update.id` was published as a UUID while
// `actual_categories_update.id` was published as any string. That is not a convention a
// reader can rely on, and the api-design-principles skill claimed it was one.
//
// The sweep is only half the fix. Tier four grew to 18 fields one tool at a time, and it
// will do so again unless something fails the build. That is this file.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/tool_id_schema_drift.test.js
